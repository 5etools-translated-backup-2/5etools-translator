				"Kiedy Tyreus był młody i mieszkał w rozległym, wewnętrznie skłóconym planarnym mieście Ravnica, jego rodzice, Tyberio i Ayraea, zabronili mu jakichkolwiek studiów nad magią czy czarodziejstwem. Nie chcieli, aby Tyreus wplątał się w życie pełne niebezpieczeństw i przekrętów, co było powszechne w Ravnicy. Tyreus zrozumiał jednak, że przynajmniej część motywów, którymi kierował się ojciec, zabraniając magii, wynikała z buntu Tyberiusza przeciwko swoim żądnym przygód rodzicom. Kiedy dowiedział się, że jego babka była kiedyś potężnym magiem, Tyreus zapragnął pójść w jej ślady.",

In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience."

Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility."
