Czy to celowo, czy przypadkowo, taki czyn stanowi trwałą plamę, która naznacza anioła jako wyrzutka. Upadłe anioły zachowują swoją moc, ale tracą więź z bóstwami, z których zostały stworzone. Większość upadłych aniołów traktuje wygnanie osobiście, buntując się przeciwko władzy, której służyli, i starając się o władzę nad częścią Otchłani lub miejsce wśród innych upadłych w hierarchii Dziewięciu Piekieł. Zariel, władca pierwszej warstwy Dziewięciu Piekieł, jest właśnie taką istotą. Zamiast buntować się, niektóre upadłe anioły rezygnują z odosobnionej egzystencji na Płaszczyźnie Materialnej, żyjąc w przebraniu prostych pustelników. Jeśli zostaną odkupieni, mogą stać się potężnymi sprzymierzeńcami oddanymi sprawiedliwości i współczuciu."
