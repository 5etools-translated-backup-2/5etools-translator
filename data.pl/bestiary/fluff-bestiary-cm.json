Żywi urazę do Harperów i Ryllii za uwięzienie go w miejscu, które przypomina mu o ludziach, których stracił w dzieciństwie, ale pociesza się też, że może żyć życiem, jakie mógł wieść. Czas spędzony sam na sam ze swoimi myślami w Wisteria Vale sprawił, że zaczął podejrzewać, iż Harperowie nigdy nie znajdą lekarstwa i że po prostu czekali, aż stanie się na tyle zadufany, że będą mogli go zabić, nie stanowiąc dla niego zagrożenia. Zepsucie Quilla przekonało go, że Harfiarze stali się potężną siłą, którą trzeba zniszczyć. Ufa, że tylko on sam potrafi zidentyfikować i wyeliminować agentów tyranii.",

Mała grupa ostatecznie osiedliła się w lesie w pobliżu Bramy Baldura, gdzie rekrutuje nowych członków. Pod okrutną opieką Bak Meia i jego ekscentrycznych metod treningowych, zakon rósł w siłę i liczebność, żyjąc w odosobnieniu, podczas gdy on sam planował zemstę na swoich byłych przełożonych.",
