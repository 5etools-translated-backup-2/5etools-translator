				"欢乐之域对于费城来说，就像恐惧之域对于影城一样：由强大的生物统治的封闭领域。恐惧之域由黑暗领主统治，而快乐之域则由大精灵统治--最强大的费伊生物。大主教为他们的欢乐之域赋予形式，以他们独特的方式塑造它。有些快乐之域是明亮的，有些则是阴郁的，但每一个都反映了其统治者的情绪状态。一个快乐之域可以小到几英亩，大到一个国家。",

						"翡冷翠对无拘无束的情绪有反应。如果附近有激烈的争论，花儿转身颤抖是很常见的。如果有人充满恶意，他们的脚印可能会使脚下的草枯萎，或使地下的昆虫和虫子钻到地面。鸟儿在那些快乐的人面前欢快地鸣叫，而对那些长期沉闷的人则愤怒地鸣叫。多管闲事的树木靠过来偷听阴谋的低语，渴望得到他们以后可以八卦的美味花絮，而一块岩石可能会重塑自己，看起来像在岩石表面快乐地晒太阳的生物。",

								"Seelie和Unseelie Fey聚集在法庭上。Seelie的法庭被称为夏季法庭，Unseelie的法庭被称为阴暗法庭。这两个法庭都延伸到了精灵世界的各个角落，所以他们的代表几乎可以在这个存在平面上的任何地方遇到。夏季宫廷和阴阳宫廷绝不是唯一伟大的费伊宫廷，但它们是物质界的生物最熟悉的，也是最广泛的。",
								"夏季法庭和阴暗法庭是如何形成的是一个谜。也许有些费伊人对自然界有更深的亲近感，并选择模仿它，而其他费伊人则开始控制自然，用魔法来发明新的生活方式。不管是什么情况，无数的费伊人追求这两条道路，这就成了两个法庭，从那时起，他们之间一直在争吵。",

								"每隔一段时间，这两位女王就会交恶，导致整个精灵世界的紧张局势加剧。如果她们中的一个能达到自己的目的，通常的争吵就会变成流血事件。但是，只有费伊女王能向对方宣布全面战争，要让她们放弃相对的和平，将她们的法庭投入暴力和混乱之中，需要一些极端的事情。",
								"夏季法庭和阴暗法庭没有任何类似于共同防御的协议，一想到有这样的协议，双方都会发出嘲笑声。如果一支崛起的福摩瑞人军队或其他威胁危及一个法院，人们普遍认为，另一个法院不会干预，除非它也受到同一个敌人的威胁。",
