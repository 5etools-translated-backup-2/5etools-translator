								"Los brillantes dragones de zafiro son los más territoriales de todos los dragones de gemas hasta un grado peligroso. Recogen armas y armaduras mágicas como piezas centrales de sus acervos y las guardan en cavernas aisladas.",
								"La naturaleza psiónica de un dragón de zafiro es evidente en las estructuras de los cuernos y los huesos de su cuerpo. Las púas de la cola y las puntas de los cuernos son piezas separadas, pero flotan en algunos lugares, mantenidas en alto por la fuerza psíquica del dragón mientras éste vive. Estos cuernos y espinas levitantes cambian ligeramente según el estado de ánimo del dragón, balanceándose con diversión o encendiéndose peligrosamente con la ira. Sus escamas y las membranas de las alas son de diversos tonos de azul, que van desde los tonos claros de un cielo primaveral hasta el rico azul cristalino de las gemas de zafiro y el hielo glacial comprimido. A la luz, muchas de sus escamas relucen y brillan con luminosas imágenes de estrellas.",
								"A diferencia de la mayoría de los dragones, las escamas de las crías de los dragones de zafiro son de una rica tonalidad azul y de un brillo resplandeciente que tendrán durante toda su vida.",
