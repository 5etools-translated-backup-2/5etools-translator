No querían que Tyreus se viera envuelto en una vida de peligros y trampas, como era habitual en Rávnica. Pero Tyreus llegó a comprender que, al menos en parte, el motivo de su padre para prohibir la magia era la propia rebelión de Tyberio contra sus padres aventureros. Cuando se enteró de que su abuela había sido una poderosa maga, Tyreus quiso seguir sus pasos.",

In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience."

Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility."
