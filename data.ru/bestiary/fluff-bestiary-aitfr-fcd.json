Они не хотели, чтобы Тирей втянулся в жизнь, полную опасностей и коварства, как это было принято в Равнике. Но Тиреус понял, что, по крайней мере, частично мотивом запрета на магию со стороны его отца был бунт самого Тиберио против своих родителей-авантюристов. Когда он узнал, что его бабушка когда-то была сильным магом, Тиреус захотел пойти по ее стопам.",

Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience."

Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility."
