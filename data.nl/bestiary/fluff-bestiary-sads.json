								"De glinsterende saffierdraken zijn de meest territoriale van alle edelsteendraken, tot een gevaarlijke graad. Zij verzamelen magische wapens en harnassen als de pronkstukken van hun voorraad en bergen deze op in geïsoleerde grotten.",
								"De psionische aard van een saffierdraak is duidelijk in de hoorn- en botstructuren van hun lichaam. Hun staartstekels en hoornpunten zijn allemaal afzonderlijke stukken, maar ze zweven op plaatsen, omhoog gehouden door de psychische kracht van de draak terwijl de draak leeft. Deze zwevende hoorns en stekels veranderen lichtjes met de gemoedstoestand van de draak, kloppend van vermaak of gevaarlijk flakkerend van woede. Zijn schubben en vleugelmembranen zijn in verschillende tinten blauw, variërend van de lichte tinten van een lentelucht tot het rijke kristalachtige azuur van saffieren edelstenen en samengeperst gletsjerijs. In het licht glinsteren en schitteren veel van hun schubben met lichtgevende sterrenbeelden.",
