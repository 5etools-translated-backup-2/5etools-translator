Ze wilden niet dat Tyreus verwikkeld zou raken in een leven vol gevaar en schurkenstreken - zoals gebruikelijk was in Ravnica. Maar Tyreus begreep dat Tyberio's eigen rebellie tegen zijn avontuurlijke ouders in ieder geval een deel van zijn vaders motief was om magie te verbieden. Toen hij hoorde dat zijn grootmoeder ooit een machtige magiër was geweest, wilde Tyreus in haar voetsporen treden.",

In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience."

Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility."
