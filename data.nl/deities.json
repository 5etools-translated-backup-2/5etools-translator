				"Abbathor heeft geen vaardigheid in handwerk. In plaats daarvan vertrouwt hij op zijn vaardigheid als dief om zich toe te eigenen wat hij wil. Waarom zo hard werken om iets te vervaardigen als er een veel gemakkelijker pad naar rijkdom open ligt?",
				"Abbathor is de enige voorstander van verandering binnen het dwergen pantheon. Hij kan dwergen inspireren om kortere wegen te zoeken, die normaal gesproken worden afgekeurd, maar soms blijken die methoden efficiënte technieken te zijn die de mogelijkheden van een clan verbeteren."

Net als de zon kan hij naar het rijk van de duisternis gaan, maar onvermijdelijk zal zijn heldere blik weer op de wereld vallen. Amaunator wordt gezien als een strenge en meedogenloze godheid, vergelijkbaar met Silvanus, maar hij is niet bezorgd over de balans van het leven - hij zorgt ervoor dat alles volgens de hemelse orde verloopt, dat beloften worden nagekomen en dat de rechtsorde blijft bestaan.",
				"Boeren en reizigers smeken hem als zij om regen of zon bidden, evenals anderen die een gunstige weersverandering verwachten. Maar de meest voorkomende vorm van verzoening met Amaunator is het zweren van eden, het ondertekenen van contracten en het uitvaardigen van wetten onder het licht van de zon. Het verband tussen een plechtige eed en de zon is zo diep geworteld in de algemene perceptie dat zij die zich bezighouden met het sluiten van overeenkomsten of het uitvaardigen van edicten vaak pauzeren en wachten tot een voorbijtrekkende wolk de zon heeft opgeklaard alvorens de transactie of de uitspraak af te ronden."

				"De openlijke verering van Asmodeus begon ongeveer een eeuw geleden, toen kleine sekten met charismatische leiders ontstonden in de nasleep van de Spreukenplaag. Die catastrofe liet velen vragen waarom de goden boos waren of hen verlaten hadden. De gelovigen van Asmodeus boden antwoorden en een god die al hun fouten zou vergeven. Toch worstelde de Cultus van Asmodeus de volgende decennia om geaccepteerd te worden.",
				"In het geloof van het volk van het Noorden - dat overeenkomt met vele verhalen van dwergen, elfen en anderen - is Asmodeus Heer van de Negende, de leider van alle duivels van de Negen Hells. De mensen kennen duivels als ijzervretende en zoetgevooisde leveranciers van verleidingen, wier prijs voor hun gunsten zo hoog kan zijn als iemands ziel. Er wordt gezegd dat wanneer een ziel op de Fugue Plane wacht op een godheid om haar naar het juiste hiernamaals te brengen, duivels de ziel benaderen en haar een kans op macht en onsterfelijke genoegens bieden. Het enige wat een ziel hoeft te doen, is een stap uit het stof en de menigte te zetten en een voet op de eerste sport van de helse ladder te zetten die de hiërarchie van de Negen Hemelen vertegenwoordigt.",
				"De gelovigen van Asmodeus erkennen dat duivels hun aanbidders een pad bieden dat niet voor iedereen is weggelegd - net zoals het eeuwig koesteren in het licht van Lathander of het eindeloos zwaaien met een hamer in de mijnen van Moradin misschien niet voor iedereen is weggelegd. Zij die Asmodeus bij leven dienen hopen na de dood te worden opgeroepen uit de kreunende massa's van het Fugue Plane. Zij verlangen naar de kans om hun eigen lot te bepalen, met de hele eeuwigheid om hun doelen te bereiken.",
				"Aan hen die niet zo toegewijd zijn, bieden priesters van Asmodeus het vooruitzicht op uitstel in het hiernamaals. Alle zielen wachten op de Fugue Plane op het genoegen van een godheid, die bepaalt waar een ziel de rest van de eeuwigheid zal doorbrengen. Zij die hun leven het meest in overeenstemming met de zienswijze van een godheid hebben geleefd, worden het eerst opgenomen. Anderen, die in de ogen van hun favoriete god hebben overtreden of geen bepaalde ethiek hebben gevolgd, kunnen eeuwen wachten voordat Kelemvor bepaalt waar zij heengaan. Mensen die zo'n lot vrezen, kunnen tot Asmodeus bidden, zeggen zijn priesters, en in ruil daarvoor zal een duivel de wachtende ziel enige troost schenken.",
				"Vandaag de dag zijn heiligdommen voor Asmodeus nog steeds zeldzaam en tempels bijna ongehoord, maar veel mensen hebben de gewoonte aangenomen om Asmodeus om uitstel van hun zonden te vragen. Na op de een of andere manier tegen een god te hebben gezondigd, bidt men tot Asmodeus voor iets dat respijt geeft tijdens het lange wachten. Asmodeus staat erom bekend dat hij de mensen geeft wat zij wensen, en dus bidden de mensen om alle genoegens en afleidingen die zij het meest van het leven verlangen. Degenen die op grote schaal overtredingen begaan, vragen Asmodeus vaak hun zonden voor de goden te verbergen, en priesters zeggen dat hij dat zal doen, maar met een prijs na de dood."

						"Alle stervelingen zijn voorbestemd om Athreos, de Riviergids, te ontmoeten wanneer hun leven ten einde loopt. De god van de doorgang brengt de doden over de rivier de Tartyx en brengt elke sterfelijke ziel naar haar bestemming in de Onderwereld. Voor de meeste mensen belichaamt Athreos de grootste mysteries van het bestaan - de angst en het wonder van het laatste moment van het leven en de openbaring van iemands uiteindelijke lot in het hiernamaals. Athreos is echter geen rechter. De gesluierde, zwijgende god ondergaat geen beraadslagingen en maakt geen uitzonderingen. De Riviergids leest de waarheid van elke ziel en brengt die feilloos naar zijn juiste plaats in de Onderwereld. Er wordt niet gemarchandeerd en er is geen medelijden op Athreos' boot, de god heeft elk denkbaar pleidooi van de stervelingen gehoord en afgewezen.",
						"Athreos verschijnt als een uitgemergelde figuur gehuld in haveloze gewaden en een verzameling gouden maskers. Het weinige dat van zijn lichaam te zien is, is verontrustend, met grijs vlees dat dun is opgerekt over een nauwelijks menselijk skelet. De Riviergids is nooit zonder zijn oude staf, Katabasis, die hij verandert in de veerboot waarmee hij de Rivieren bevaart die de wereld omringen. Hoewel de verhulde gedaante van de godheid geen aanwijzing geeft, beschouwen veel stervelingen Athreos als een man, maar de Riviergids geeft niet meer om termen of labels dan welke andere natuurkracht dan ook. Athreos kan van gedaante veranderen, maar neemt zelden of nooit andere vormen aan.",

								"De meeste stervelingen richten zich op de rol van de River Guide in hun eigen dood. Talloze sterfelijke bijgeloven schrijven manieren voor om Athreos' gunst te verwerven, maar alles wat Athreos eist van degenen die hij transporteert is betaling: een enkele munt van welke muntsoort of waarde dan ook. De River Guide heeft een uitgebreide definitie van wat een munt is, van echt gestempeld geld en juwelen tot glanzende kralen of opalescente schelpen. Uiteindelijk lijkt het hem er vooral om te gaan of een sterveling zich op zijn dood heeft voorbereid, door het geld klaar te houden uit respect en als een persoonlijk memento mori. Degenen wiens lichamen verbrand, begraven of op een andere manier verwijderd worden samen met kostbaarheden die opzettelijk voor de Riviergids bestemd zijn, ontdekken dat zij deze voorwerpen kunnen gebruiken bij het ruilen voor Athreos' diensten. Geesten die onvoorbereid de oevers van de Tartyx-rivier bereiken, lopen echter het risico te stranden, aangezien Athreos weigert degenen die niet kunnen betalen te vervoeren.",
								"Athreos wordt ook aangeroepen als de god van de doorgang, en als de godheid die heerst over grenzen, begrenzingen en dat wat \"geen van beide\" is. Wie een reis onderneemt, vooral een gevaarlijke, gooit vaak een muntje in een fontein of een watermassa als apotropisch eerbetoon aan de riviergids. Bruggen en grenzen zijn ook plaatsen waar Athreos vaak wordt herdacht, en veel van zulke plaatsen worden gemarkeerd door motieven van rivieren of geesten. Bovendien worden fenomenen die noch het een noch het ander zijn, en die geen eenvoudige classificatie toelaten, vaak beschouwd als behorend tot Athreos' gebied - in het bijzonder de toestand tussen leven en dood, maar ook echo's, fantoomsensaties, en het gevoel van déjà vu.",

In plaats daarvan doet hij wat gedaan moet worden, en als een kosmologische toestand uit de hand loopt, werken de Riviergids en zijn dienaren met stille efficiëntie om het evenwicht te herstellen."

Zolang andere goden zich niet op de grens tussen leven en dood begeven, hetzij door hun grenzen te overschrijden, hetzij door te proberen de doden weer tot leven te wekken, heeft de Riviergids weinig met hen te maken. Meer dan eens heeft dit isolement Athreos in een stil conflict gebracht met Heliod en Erebos, die het Athreos allebei subtiel kwalijk nemen dat hij beperkt heeft hoeveel ze zich in elkaars rijk mogen mengen. Tegelijkertijd voorkomt de rol van de Riviergids als buffer tussen de twee wraakzuchtige goden dat hun wrok ontaardt in een goddelijke oorlog.",
										"Thassa heeft een koud respect voor Athreos. In een tijd voor de afrekening, scheidden grenzen de heerschappij van de god van de zee van de Tartyx rivier. Hoewel de god van de zee er een hekel aan heeft zelfs maar een druppel water te delen, beschouwt zij de Riviergids als een stille, onopvallende indringer in haar favoriete element en houdt zij afstand. Maar als haar respect zou afnemen, zou Thassa gretig wedijveren om de Rivieren die de wereld omringen te beheersen."

Sommige mensen worden te ruste gelegd met grote hoeveelheden grafgiften. Gedenkpraktijken variëren sterk per cultuur, van trieste, sombere zaken tot levendige vieringen. Deze rituelen dienen echter meer als catharsis voor de levenden dan als betekenisvolle zegeningen voor Athreos.

Ze boden hem ook een zekere mate van hoop. De goden wierpen Athreos' offers terug in de sterfelijke wereld in de vorm van vijf munten. Ze beloofden Athreos dat, zodra hij de munten opnieuw zou verzamelen, de goden de Riviergids van zijn dienst zouden bevrijden en hem in hun gelederen zouden verwelkomen. Sindsdien heeft Athreos gezwoegd, zowel bij het overzetten van de doden als bij het zoeken naar zijn vijf verloren munten, die de Athrean Obols worden genoemd.

Deze figuur is Solyssia, eens een orakel van Meletis. Solyssia weigert Athreos' prijs te betalen, of die voor haar te laten betalen. Eeuwenlang heeft ze de pas gestorvenen lastig gevallen en daarbij heeft ze ongelooflijk veel geleerd over de sterfelijke wereld.

Als bewijs van deze uitzonderingen draagt Athreos van elk individu een masker dat op een Teruggekeerde lijkt. Ondanks eeuwen tussen de akkoorden is er echter nooit iemand teruggekeerd voor wie Athreos een uitzondering heeft gemaakt. Daarom weigert de River Guide om nog een uitzondering te maken.

In Luskan verzamelen bezoekers zich bij de tempel om de regelmatige \"natte optochten\" bij te wonen, een ritueel waarbij smekelingen kledingstukken aantrekken die met ijs zijn ingepakt. Vervolgens begeven zij zich tussen zes witte pilaren die bekend staan als de Kussen van Auril en die over de stad verspreid staan. De aanbidders gaan van pilaar naar pilaar, terwijl ze gebeden tot de godin scanderen. Wanneer een smekeling een pilaar bereikt, moet hij deze beklimmen en vervolgens \"de dame kussen\", waarbij hij zijn lippen raakt aan een roestige ijzeren plaat op de top. In de winter lijken deze evenementen op hectische hardloopwedstrijden, met het extra risico van bevriezing en verwondingen door van de gladde pilaren te vallen. De optochtlopers worden toegejuicht door de kroegbezoekers die uit de nabijgelegen taveernes komen om te wedden op het uithoudingsvermogen van de deelnemers. Van degenen die de race uitlopen, wordt gedacht dat zij hebben geholpen de winter te verlichten, en zij hoeven de hele winter zelden voor eten of bier te betalen."

Terwijl Mystra bijvoorbeeld de godheid is die de ziel, de kunst en het wonder van de magie vertegenwoordigt, is Azuth de god van de lange studie-uren van een tovenaar, de strenge normen voor beweging en spraak, en de verkrampte, met inkt besmeurde vingers. Tovenaars roepen Azuth aan wanneer zij rollen schrijven, magische cirkels schrijven, spreuken uit het hoofd proberen te leren, en zelfs wanneer zij spreuken uitspreken. Vaak komt deze erkenning in de vorm van het in stilte vormen van Azuth's heilige symbool, door met de wijsvinger van de linkerhand naar de hemel te wijzen. Voor veel tovenaars is dit gebaar zo gewoon in hun leven dat het een onbewuste gewoonte wordt.",
				"Tempels gewijd aan Azuth zijn schaars, en geestelijken van de godheid zijn uiterst zeldzaam. Zelfs in het met magie verzadigde Halruaa zijn slechts een handvol heilige plaatsen aan Azuth gewijd. Soms staat er een standbeeld of een schrijn in een hoek van een tempel voor Mystra of een andere godheid. Vaker heeft een tovenaar een persoonlijke schrijn thuis. Azuth wordt op dergelijke plaatsen afgebeeld als een figuur met een kap en baard, de linkerhand hoog gehouden en de vinger omhoog. Soms wordt hij alleen met de hand afgebeeld. In beide gevallen dient de vinger vaak als kandelaar of als punt van oorsprong voor een lichtspreuk."

				"Beshaba is de tegenpool van Tymora en wordt in het dagelijks leven even vaak erkend als haar meer welwillende \"zuster\". Zij wordt gezien als een wrede en wispelturige godin die gunstig moet worden gestemd om te voorkomen dat haar aandacht en belangstelling op een negatieve manier worden getrokken.",
				"Beshaba's naam wordt aangeroepen wanneer iemand pech heeft - dat kan zo klein zijn als het stoten van een teen of het breken van een wagenwiel, of zo catastrofaal als uitglijden en per ongeluk van een klif vallen. Het wordt ook aangeroepen om haar aandacht af te wenden wanneer iemand iets doet waarbij geluk geen rol speelt maar pech misschien wel. Bijvoorbeeld, iemand die dobbelt zou Tymora aanroepen omdat hij wil dat het toeval in zijn voordeel valt, maar iemand die op het punt staat een gammele brug over te steken zou Beshaba vragen de brug intact te houden.",
				"De mensen maken het symbool van Beshaba door hun duimen in te vouwen en de vingers van één of beide handen te strekken (en zo de hoorns van haar heilige symbool na te bootsen) om ongeluk af te wenden. Hetzelfde gebaar, naar het hoofd geheven, betekent een groet; wanneer de \"hoorns\" naar iemand gericht zijn, duiden zij op een slechte gunst jegens die persoon.",
				"Vele druïden vereren Beshaba als een van de Eerste Cirkel. Zij aanbidden haar met dansen terwijl zij een vuurzwart gewei dragen dat in bloed is gedoopt. Volgens deze druïden zijn de hoorns van een hert haar heilige symbool, omdat toen Beshaba voor het eerst werd vereerd, de mensen eenvoudige jagers-verzamelaars waren en men geloofde dat zij ongeluk bracht aan jagers, zoals door een hert worden doorboord.",
				"Hoewel de meeste mensen bevreesd zijn voor de aanwezigheid van Beshaba op om het even welke gebeurtenis (zelfs in de geest), wordt Beshaba bijna altijd aangeroepen en formeel verwelkomd in de openingstoespraken of plechtigheden van formele functies zoals huwelijken en kroningen, wedstrijden van sport of krijgshaftigheid, en bij de doopplechtigheden van kinderen. Als zij niet voor een dergelijke gebeurtenis wordt uitgenodigd, kan zij aanstoot nemen en ongeluk brengen aan de betrokkenen.",
				"Tempels voor Beshaba zijn zo goed als onbekend. Het is echter gebruikelijk dat plattelandsbewoners een paal oprichten en er een gewei aan bevestigen op de plaats van een ongeval langs de weg of een moord. In steden, waar geweien moeilijk te krijgen zijn en moorden en ongelukken meer voorkomen, is het de gewoonte om het zwarte gewei van Beshaba met houtskool op een nabijgelegen muur te tekenen en het symbool te laten staan tot het weer het wegvaagt. Deze \"heiligdommen\", in welke vorm dan ook, dienen om anderen te waarschuwen voor plaatsen waar ongeluk dreigt.",
				"Meer formele heiligdommen voor Beshaba bestaan op plaatsen waar de mensen vaak onheil hopen af te wenden. Deze plaatsen bestaan meestal uit roodgeverfde palen of stenen waaraan een zwartgeblakerd gewei is bevestigd, of uit een rode, driehoekige gedenkplaat aan de wand waaraan een gewei is bevestigd. Beide types hebben een stenen of bronzen schaal waarin munten kunnen worden gegooid of brandoffers kunnen worden gebracht. De Rode Tovenaars van Thay richten gewoonlijk dergelijke heiligdommen op buiten hun rituele kamers om hen te beschermen tegen ongelukkige vergissingen.",
				"Weinigen durven Beshaba als beschermheilige te nemen. De zeldzame geestelijken van het Meisje van Tegenslag zijn zij die diep getroffen zijn door grote tegenslagen en die anderen willen waarschuwen voor de essentiële oneerlijkheid van het leven - of die oneerlijkheid aan hen willen toebrengen."

				"De mensen van Faerûn bidden normaal niet voor of erkennen Bhaal. Hij wordt gezien als een zeer kwaadaardige en destructieve godheid die hunkert naar de dood - dat wil zeggen de dood van alle voelende wezens door middel van onwettige middelen.",
				"Sommige mensen bidden tot Bhaal als zij een moord willen plegen. Iemand kan een goede reden hebben om zijn toevlucht te nemen tot moord, bijvoorbeeld wanneer men niet in staat is een onrechtvaardige daad met wettige middelen te herstellen. Maar het is veel gebruikelijker dat tot Bhaal wordt gebeden door hen die iemand willen doden uit jaloezie, hebzucht of toorn. Alleen moordenaars of dwangmatige moordenaars nemen Bhaal als beschermheilige, en geestelijken die Bhaal vereren komen vaak op beide punten in aanmerking.",
				"In het verleden zijn er moordcultussen van Bhaal ontstaan, elk geleid door een charismatische, zelfbenoemde priester van Bhaal, maar georganiseerde verering van de Heer van de Moord is uiterst ongewoon. Tempels en heiligdommen zijn eveneens zeldzaam. Wie een heiligdom voor Bhaal opricht, doet dat meestal om hem te bedanken voor een geslaagde moord. Dergelijke heiligdommen hebben meestal een schedel of een afgehakt hoofd omringd door druppels bloed (vaak beide van het vermoorde slachtoffer)."

Verhalen over Brandobaris, vol list en ontsnappingspogingen, inspireren veel jonge halflingen tot guitige bezigheden. In hun verbeelding wordt een graansilo een hoge tovenaarstoren om te beklimmen op zoek naar schatten, of wordt een roeiboot het decor voor een roekeloos avontuur. En voor sommigen - de jongeren van wie wordt gezegd dat ze \"een beetje Brandobaris in zich hebben\" - is dat spel de opmaat tot een leven zoals Brandobaris dat doet: altijd op zoek naar de volgende uitdaging.",

Zijn nieuwsgierigheid brengt hem naar alle hoeken van het multiversum op zoek naar magische curiosa, zeldzame schatten, en mystieke puzzels. Als Brandobaris zich heimelijk beweegt, kan geen sterveling of god zijn voetstappen horen - een vermogen dat hij niet alleen gebruikt ter verdediging, maar ook om degenen die hij gunstig gezind is onvoorziene traktaties te schenken.",
				"Hoewel hij nooit lijkt te rusten tijdens zijn reizen, heeft Brandobaris altijd tijd om halflingen te belonen die risico's durven nemen en de wereld verkennen om er hun eigen stempel op te drukken. Hij staat erom bekend dat hij halflingen in nood een beetje helpt door ze een tijdje onzichtbaar te maken of door tussenbeide te komen zodat ze niet gehoord of opgespoord kunnen worden."

De god houdt van magie, kunstzinnigheid, natuur en vrijheid.

In ruil voor deze vrijheid van godsdienst verwacht Corellon dat zij hun eigen problemen aanpakken en niet bij elke crisis om hulp bidden. Deze voorschriften worden in elke elf ingeprent, aangezien alle elfen uiteindelijk afstammen van fragmenten van Corellon. Wanneer elfen aan hun priesters vragen hoe je de aanwezigheid van Corellon kunt voelen, zeggen de priesters vaak: \"Leer eerst jezelf echt kennen. Alleen dan kun je onze schepper dichtbij voelen.\" Diensten ter ere van Corellon worden meestal gehouden in amfitheaters van natuursteen of komvormige open plekken in het bos. In overeenstemming met Corellon's voornaamste gebod dat iedereen vrij moet zijn, mogen alle aanwezigen hun eerbied betuigen zoals zij dat willen, zolang hun manier van bijdragen maar samengaat met die van de anderen om een groots vertoon van eerbied te vormen. Zo'n bijeenkomst heeft meer de sfeer van een festival dan van een georganiseerde eredienst.",

						" Alleen die langlevende geleerden die de elfen met de grootste vasthoudendheid hebben onderzocht, hebben gehoord van de Mysteriën van Arvandor, en het enige dat deze grootheden ooit hebben kunnen verzamelen is dat het een geheime bijeenkomst is van elfen, gewijd aan Corellon, waar een magische herhaling van de elfenmythen van de schepping gezamenlijk wordt beleefd.",
						"De waarheid is dat de Mysteriën van Arvandor een fenomeen zijn dat elfen herkennen als een oproep van hun schepper, die zij kunnen kiezen te aanvaarden of te negeren. De gebeurtenis vindt plaats op één vlak of op meerdere vlakken in het multiversum op één enkel moment, en er is geen garantie dat het ooit weer zal gebeuren; het vermogen om de oproep te horen is een zeldzame gave. Afhankelijk van Corellon's behoefte kan de god enkele tientallen of enkele duizenden elfen oproepen zich te verzamelen, waarbij elke elf tijdelijk terugkeert naar Corellon's lichaam voor een taak die alleen de god kan begrijpen.",
						"Voordat deze bijeenkomst begint, krijgen de geselecteerde elfen krachtige dromen en wakkere visioenen, die hen aansporen om naar een bepaalde plaats te reizen. Op dit punt moet elk van de opgeroepen elfen kiezen of hij de visioenen zal volgen, want het is bekend dat niet elke elf terugkeert van een ontmoeting met Corellon. Het is waar dat het opnieuw opgaan in de god, en terugkeren naar het bewustzijn van voor het trekken van de sluier, de vervulling is van het verlangen van elke elf, maar sommige elfen zijn gehecht geraakt aan de sterfelijke en alledaagse wereld, en keren zich daarom af van de oproep van hun god. Zij die gehoor geven aan de oproep van Corellon worden telepathisch naar hun bestemming geleid, vaak honderden kilometers over onbekend terrein, of zelfs over planes.",
						"De meeste elfen die uit de Mysteriën terugkeren, zijn voor altijd getransformeerd. Deze deelnemers zwijgen over het algemeen over hun ervaring, uit eerbied en waardering. Degenen die over de Mysteriën van Arvandor spreken, hebben moeite om de juiste woorden te vinden, maar zij zeggen allemaal op de een of andere manier dat het ervaren van de Mysteriën voor elfen een manier is om zich met Corellon te verenigen, waarbij zij de god hun levenskracht schenken - en in ruil daarvoor keren zij voor een tijd terug naar hun vrije, vormloze natuur. Na deze mystieke communie hebben veel elfen een dieper begrip van hun oorsprong en een steviger greep op magie, en sommige genieten van een blijvende telepathische verbinding met anderen die in de Mysteriën zijn ingewijd.",
						"Cryptische heiligdommen voor de Mysteriën van Arvandor verschijnen overal op de planes, meestal plaatsen waar gebeeldhouwde of geschilderde sterren het plafond van een grot bedekken. Op de planes waar een van deze zeldzame gebeurtenissen heeft plaatsgevonden, wijden elf priesters tempels in die gewijd zijn aan de Mysteriën. Vaak zijn deze heilige plaatsen natuurlijke ruimtes die intrinsieke magische eigenschappen hebben.",
						"Verhalen over de Mysteriën worden door veel theologen verkondigd als voorbeelden van Corellons blijvende liefde voor zijn eigenzinnige kinderen. Sommige wijzen stellen zich voor dat op een dag alle elfen deze kans zullen krijgen, nadat Corellon bevredigd is door de voltooiing van een grote kosmische zoektocht, en de elfen weer een volk zullen zijn van onbelemmerde vorm en onvoorstelbare vreugde."

						"Steeds veranderend, vrolijk en mooi, konden de oer-elven elke sexe aannemen die ze maar wilden. Toen zij buigden voor Lolth's invloed en ervoor kozen hun fysieke vormen vast te zetten, verloren de elfen de mogelijkheid om op deze manier te transformeren. Toch worden er af en toe elfen geboren die zo androgyn zijn dat zij tot de gezegenden van Corellon worden uitgeroepen - levende symbolen van de liefde van de god en van de oorspronkelijke vloeiende staat van het oer-elfen-zijn. Veel van Corellon's opperpriesters dragen deze zegen.",
						"De zeldzaamste van deze gezegende elfen kunnen van geslacht veranderen wanneer zij een lange rustpauze beëindigen - een wonder dat gevierd wordt door alle soorten elfen behalve drow. (De DM beslist of een elf dit wonder kan manifesteren.) Duistere elfen vinden dit vermogen angstaanjagend en karakteriseren het als een vloek, want het zou hun hele samenleving kunnen destabiliseren. Als de zegen van Corellon zich manifesteert in een drow, vlucht die elf meestal naar de oppervlaktewereld om onderdak te zoeken bij de aan Corellon toegewijde elfen."

				"De verering van Cyric vloeit rechtstreeks voort uit het verhaal van zijn opgang tot godheid. Cyric was een sterveling tijdens de Tijd der Troebelen en de sleutel tot de oplossing van die chaotische periode, maar hij was ook een zelfzuchtige verrader en een moordenaar. Toen hij god werd, bleef Cyric verschillende complotten van bedrog en moord smeden - het beroemdste is dat Cyric, volgens de legende, Mystra heeft vermoord en zo meer dan een eeuw geleden de Spreukenplaag heeft veroorzaakt.",
				"Zij die Cyric niet aanbidden zien hem als een god van waanzin, strijd en bedrog, hoewel zijn priesters dergelijke beweringen als ketterij beschouwen. Hun leugenprins is geen doorgedraaide gek, maar een god van duistere majesteit, die bewijst dat uiteindelijk alle banden tussen de mensen corrumperen en verdwijnen.",
				"Cyric's kerk werkt openlijk in Amn, waar de burgers de principes van ambitie, zelfredzaamheid en \"koper moet oppassen\" aanhangen. Degenen die Cyric als hun beschermheer nemen, zijn meestal sadisten, oplichters, machtswellustelingen en erger. Andere mensen bidden tot Cyric als zij iets verkeerds willen doen, maar niet willen dat anderen dat te weten komen.",
				"\"De Donkere Zon\", oorspronkelijk een van Cyric's bijnamen, is een metafoor geworden voor onenigheid in de Rijken. \"Een donkere zon is opgegaan over dit hof\" kan worden uitgesproken als waarschuwing dat intriges en onenigheid uit de hand zijn gelopen in een adellijk huishouden; en getrouwde stellen weten dat ze anderen om raad moeten vragen als \"een donkere zon door het raam schijnt\" in hun relatie."

Het huis is een gastvrije plaats, maar het is ook heilig. Halflingen eren Cyrrollalee door hun huis open te stellen voor bezoekers, en door het huis van de gastheer te respecteren alsof het je eigen huis is.",
				"Elk halflingendorp vertelt zijn versie van het legendarische verhaal van Cyrrollalee en de trollenpastei. Lang geleden werd een grote mensenstad in de buurt van Cyrrollalee's dorp regelmatig aangevallen door een gemene trol. Krijgers uit de stad hakten in op de trol, maar zelfs zijn ergste wonden genazen, en de trol kwam weer terug. Op een dag verscheen Cyrrollalee aan de poort van de stad in schort en boerenkleren, en zij bood aan de stad te verlossen van de trol. De trotse menselijke krijgers spotten allemaal met haar, maar de wanhopige burgemeester vroeg Cyrrollalee om haar hulp.",
				"Dus liet Cyrrollalee alle mensen in de stad taarten bakken, maar niet zomaar taarten. Het waren speciale trollen taarten. In elke taart stopte ze een snufje magie om ze onweerstaanbaar te maken voor trollen. Terwijl de krijgers van de stad mopperden en hun staal slijpten, creëerde Cyrrollalee een sfeer van plezier en vrolijkte de bange mensen op terwijl ze werkten. Toen de dag voorbij was, vertrok ze met een kar vol taarten en legde ze in een smakelijk spoor tot ver in de bergen. Toen de trol in de buurt van de stad kwam en het spoor vond, begon hij taart na taart op te eten en volgde de heerlijke geuren op het bergpad tot hij recht in het hol van een jonge rode draak liep. De gulzige trol werd snel verbrand.",
				"Cyrrollalee keerde als held terug, en vanaf die dag herinnerden alle stedelingen zich haar met een woord van dank wanneer zij taarten bakten."

				"De matrone moeders waarschuwen degenen die op rooftocht naar de oppervlakte gaan om zich terug te trekken als ze de maan kunnen zien - een praktische raad, zo lijkt het. Maar een even belangrijke reden is dat Eilistraee bekend staat om haar listen bij het licht van de maan, zodat drow op zulke momenten vatbaarder zijn voor haar verlokkingen. De matrons geven de rovers ook de opdracht terug te vluchten als een van hen muziek hoort die hem aanspreekt, zoals het slaapliedje van een ouder of het refrein van een opzwepend lied dat in gedachten wordt gedragen, want Eilistraee's oproep aan drow die vrij willen zijn van Lolth's web wordt vaak gedaan met zachte melodieën die niet van buitenaardse oorsprong zijn.",

Drow die zich buitenstaanders voelen in hun samenleving, die met afschuw reageren op het kwaad dat hun soort begaat, die naar de oppervlakte komen en verliefd worden op de sterren - dat zijn degenen die blij zouden kunnen zijn Eilistraee's oproep te horen. Als zij gehoor geven aan de oproep door naar de oppervlakte te gaan en daar te blijven, biedt Eilistraee geen garantie voor hun veiligheid en geen belofte van acceptatie in de wereld daarboven. Maar zij opent de harten van haar volgelingen voor het wonder van de natuur in de nacht, en haar liederen en tekenen kunnen een drow laten zien hoe hij zich in die vreemde omgeving kan handhaven.",
				"De rollen die de moeders van de matrone zo goed bewaken, getuigen dat Eilistraee zich tegen Lolth keerde, maar beter wist dan troost te zoeken bij de Seldarijnen. Haar positie tussen de andere drow goden blijft onzeker, evenals het lot van de zielen van hen die zich tot haar aanbidding wenden. Drow die geliefd zijn door Eilistraee lijken soms te verdwijnen wanneer zij sterven, aangezien het lichaam oplost in bleek licht en geen aanwijzing achterlaat over waar de ziel is gebleven."

Haar gezegende water geneest de zieken, geneest waanzin en troost de stervenden.",

De traditie schrijft voor dat het een plaats van stille bezinning moet zijn waar anderen aan hun gedachten worden overgelaten. Een waterlichaam zoals een vijver of een bron dient gewoonlijk als een opslagplaats voor offers. Als de heilige plaats een open plek is, kan een beek die men onderweg passeert als offerplaats dienen, of een prominente struik of boom in de open plek kan de plaats zijn waar men offers vastbindt. Typische offers zijn gebroken wapens of voorwerpen die herinneren aan ruzies, die de gelovigen weggooien terwijl ze een wens doen voor vrede in de toekomst. Veel voorstanders van Eldath zijn pacifisten of mensen die zich zorgen maken over geweld dat zij hebben gezien of meegemaakt.",

Velen zijn rondtrekkend, zwervend tussen verschillende heilige plaatsen en heiligdommen, erop toeziend dat de locaties worden verzorgd en dat ze plaatsen van zoete sereniteit blijven. De gelovigen van Eldath staan meestal dicht bij de natuur, en zijn verbonden met druïden, die Eldath tot de Eerste Cirkel rekent. Het is taboe een priester van Eldath te slaan, en het doden van een priester zou groot onheil brengen. Ondanks de mate van bescherming die dit geloof hun biedt, vermijden de meeste priesters van Eldath conflicten in plaats van te proberen ze de kop in te drukken. Zij die Eldath dienen zijn graag bereid om vreedzame onderhandelingen voor te zitten en verdragen te bekrachtigen, maar zij kunnen anderen niet dwingen om in harmonie te leven."

Wanneer zij verkiest op menselijke schaal in haar steden rond te lopen, neemt zij vaak de gedaante aan van een menselijke vrouw. In beide gedaanten is zij altijd gekleed in blauw en wit, en haar uitdrukking is meestal ernstig, maar niet onvriendelijk.

She seeks for justice to prevail in civilized lands.",

Civic responsibility is essential in Ephara's eyes, and having an engaged citizenry is important. The pursuit of knowledge is also a vital task, and she encourages advances in philosophy and science. As the scholars in her cities obtain or derive new knowledge, Ephara's magic scrolls grow ever longer. Finally, art is of critical importance to a thriving city. Ephara particularly supports architecture, the creation of which often drives industry and sculpture, though she doesn't scorn other varieties of artistic expression."

Ephara looks at the wilderness and sees only wasted potential, while Nylea looks at cities and sees only destruction.",

Ephara opposes Phenax and what she sees as his utter disdain for everything she stands for.",

Ephara approves of agriculture, a key ingredient for the development of cities, and both gods are concerned with defense of settlements. Even so, Karametra is tied to Setessa and the wild lands, where Ephara is distrusted, and although Karametra and Nylea have their own complicated relationship, Karametra strongly favors Nylea over Ephara."

In the other four realms of the dead, his will is law.",

He regularly sends agents to retrieve the Returned soul or the wayward eidolon of a hero of great renown who has succeeded in returning to Theros.

Erebos believes that Heliod will one day challenge him for control of the Underworld. He looks forward to that day, certain that his lesser brother can't possibly prevail within Erebos's own territory.",

Pharika's tinctures can either extend a life or snuff it out, and Karametra's planters know that reaping follows sowing in turn.

Athreos is one of the few beings Erebos trusts to be as committed as he is to ensuring that the passage into death is a one-way trip.

Only with the first dawning was Erebos's form diminished enough that Heliod could overpower him, and the god of the dead has never forgiven his upstart brother.

				"This entity is most often referred to as That Which Lurks, because uttering its real name risks attracting its attention. Its actual form, if it even has one, is unknown; it's most often represented as an ooze-like creature with many tentacles or a purple pupil surrounded by black instead of white. The liquid nature of Ghaunadaur is symbolic of its unpredictable nature, which is what makes attracting its attention so risky. It occasionally rewards its followers with supernatural powers or wealth, but it's equally likely to curse its faithful with hideous torments and afflictions. A subterranean hunter who whispers Ghaunadaur's name might stumble into a forgotten treasure trove, while a devoted priestess who offers long prayers and valuable sacrifices is consumed by a gelatinous cube. The entity's random behavior can be an attraction to drow who lack status and are desperate to achieve it. A small sacrifice and a prayer to That Which Lurks might simply go unnoticed by Ghaunadaur, or it might punish the petitioner, but there is also a chance of receiving a great reward.",
				"Worship of That Which Lurks is widespread in the Underdark. Not just drow pay respect to it. Even creatures that are considered to be mindless, such as oozes and jellies, sometimes behave in ways that seem consistent with reverence for That Which Lurks.",
				"Those who are faithful to Lolth often oppose Ghaunadaur's cultists, driving them into hiding or forcing them into open conflict. Some priestesses and scholars believe that this enmity exists because Ghaunadaur betrayed Lolth shortly after she betrayed Corellon. In these legends, Ghaunadaur tried to curry favor with Corellon and recapture his earlier formless nature by turning on Lolth. Ghaunadaur's double act of betrayal brought retribution from both gods, and he was cast down into the world as a skinless, boneless mass. Other stories portray Ghaunadaur as an incredibly ancient and ineffable deity, one of the so-called Great Old Ones. Both claims might have merit, because the truth about the time of the birth of gods can never be known for certain."

A traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds. In large cities, the Gondar construct temples that serve as great workshops and inventors' labs. Wandering priests turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all.",

Stories of Hanali's romantic adventures among elves and other mortals are perennial favorites when sung by elf bards and poets.",

As one would navigate a river, the faithful of Hanali are known for following their hearts, unwilling to deviate from the pursuit of ultimate beauty.",

Especially vigilant individuals might even decide to clean up after others who carelessly spill a drink in a tavern or leave their dinner table in a slovenly condition, all in humble service to their god."

His profile is noble, highlighted by a strong chin and a short beard, and he boasts the broad chest of a perfectly fit athlete. His hair is glossy black, and his head is crowned with a golden wreath.

He considers himself a kind and beneficent ruler—a benign autocrat, not a tyrant—and he doesn't expect abject servility from anyone, god or mortal. He just wants everyone to defer to his will and carry out his orders.

Thassa and Nylea will continue as they are, as they always have been, whatever squabbles their brothers might have.",

In some ways, these three gods represent the principles and the abstract nature of Heliod made tangible and concrete through the lives of mortals. Heliod represents a divine, natural, moral law; Ephara gives those laws a concrete manifestation by establishing mortal society in the poleis. Heliod controls the radiant sun that makes the natural world flourish; Karametra brings the interplay of light and nature to life for mortals in the practice of agriculture. And while Heliod stands for justice, Iroas actually fights for it, taking up arms against brutality and injustice in defense of what is good and right.",

Kruphix is perhaps the only being who can impose limits on the other gods' actions, which makes Heliod resent and fear the god of horizons."

Finally, one day, Solsemon found a warm, calm place. There, a powerful voice he'd heard in his dreams welcomed him to his journey's end. Praising Heliod, the oracle took his rest, and after several long, contented hours, peacefully died.

When a guilty party falls prey to fate - such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then accidentally slain himself - the hand of Hoar is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.",
				"Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's generally believed that the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.",

Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jailor or a headsman is more likely to pray to Hoar."

Even orcs and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to their fallen warriors as well.",

When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed into action."

As the minotaur terror closed in on her, Rygyra whispered a prayer to Iroas and braced her flimsy wooden shield, knowing it would offer no defense against the giant's strikes. Yet, when the blow came, the shield resounded with the barest metallic clang—like a pin falling on bronze. Opening her eyes, Rygyra discovered that her shield had transformed into a gleaming bulwark—Iroas's own shield. Enraged, Raksolcs beat on the shield, leaving not even a dent. After hours of this, the minotaur collapsed, panting and exhausted. Only then did Rygyra emerge and strangle the brute with his own tongue."

Yet with the passing of time, he became bored with his position. Then one day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jergal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him and take his power. Instead, Jergal calmly abdicated his throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, and Bhaal the portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former stature and became a scribe of the dead.",
				"Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely acknowledged directly, except for being mentioned at funerals and among those who practice the custom of writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parchment and placing it in the corpse's mouth. This rite is common in places where an individual's grave or tomb isn't marked with the person's name.",
				"Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some way. Priests of Jergal serve communities as undertakers and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples dedicated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His faithful send their annual recordings of mortality to holy sites where records of that sort are kept.",

Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge there is nothing - and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.",
						"During this dark era arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal possessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne.",
						"\"I claim this throne of evil,\" Bane the tyrant shouted to Jergal.",
						"\"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger,\" threatened Bhaal the assassin.",
						"\"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,\" promised Myrkul the necromancer.",
						"Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, \"The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish - l promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position.\" Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead asked, \"Who among you shall rule?\"",
						"The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.",
						"\"After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office by engaging in a game of skill for them?\" asked Jergal.",
						"Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed to it. So Jergal took the skulls of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.",
						"Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would receive all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport had been ruined, but again Jergal intervened. \"Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don't have to share with the Beast?\"",
						"The trio agreed to this alternative, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.",
						"Bane cried out triumphantly, \"As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom.\"",
						"Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, \"But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die - even gods.\"",
						"Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, \"I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand.\"",
						"Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and so yet again only the beasts were left for him.",

Almost every human settlement contains at least a modest shrine to solicit her favor, and she is closely associated with Setessa, the center of her worship.",
						"Wise and even-tempered, Karametra values community, stability, and the balance of nature. She is the god of maternity, family, orphans, domestication, and agriculture, as well as defense of the home and territory.",
						"Karametra appears to mortals as a motherly figure with hair made of ordered rows of leaves that shroud her eyes from view. She is always shown in art (and often seen in Nyx) seated on her throne, which is formed from a tangle of grape vines growing out of a collection of jugs and amphorae that surround her. An elaborately carved wooden canopy extends above her, and a giant sable—her faithful companion—curls around the base of the throne at her feet. In one hand, she holds a harvester's scythe.",

But she also reminds mortals that they are part of the natural world; they are animals that eat and digest and reproduce and sleep, and Karametra is influential in all of that, as well.",
								"Mortals seek her favor because the fertility of nature is necessary for their existence. It isn't her wrath they fear—she is not a god of storms or plagues—but her withdrawal. Without her, plants, livestock, families, and communities simply fail to thrive. Her goodwill is a bulwark against both physical starvation and starvation of the spirit: despair, loneliness, and moral weakness.",
								"Karametra promises that spring will always come again, trees will always bear fruit, and flocks will always bear young. Children will always be born, parents will always care for them and be cared for in their turn. Great fortune or adventure might not be at hand, but the little joys of life—the smell of spring blossoms, the sweetness of ripe fruit, the flaming beauty of autumn leaves, the fellowship of community—can be savored.",
								"In many ways, Karametra represents the essence of the divine relationship with mortals: fertility and protection are the nucleus of the aid mortals have always sought from gods, and Karametra doesn't complicate these basic needs by couching them in terms of abstract ideals of honor or law or justice. She is the distillation of an ancient and primal exchange: mortal devotion in return for divine blessing.",

										"Karametra's closest relationship is with Heliod. He respects her civilized demeanor, and she recognizes the vital role the sun's brilliance plays in nurturing life.",
										"The relationship between Karametra and Nylea is respectful but strained. Nylea is disappointed by Karametra's decision, as a nature deity, to subordinate nature to the needs of mortals. Karametra is frustrated by what she sees as Nylea's refusal to recognize mortal folk—and all their civilizations—as part of the natural world. Despite this tension, both gods encourage their worshipers to leave offerings at each other's shrines.",
										"The gods who provoke Karametra's sharpest disdain are Iroas and Mogis, who seem devoted to the idea of preventing mortal life from fully flourishing. War—even if it's couched in noble terms, as Iroas's followers like to do—is fundamentally an instrument of death, bringing a premature and pointless end to mortal life. That said, Karametra does recognize the need to fight in defense of one's life, family, and community when they come under attack, so she and Iroas are able to find some common ground in that matter—and in their shared hatred of Mogis."

The tenets of Kelemvor's faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worshipers define \"untimely\" in different ways. One group might concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another on the prevention of murder, and yet another on eliminating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the undead that they find - an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that aren't evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider holy. Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings regardless of that fact."

On the heels of a near-catastrophic upset of the cosmic order—the rise to godhood and subsequent defeat of the satyr Xenagos—Klothys has emerged from the Underworld for the first time in mortal memory to untangle the strands of destiny and set the world right.",

The ways in which they ravaged reality to realize their selfish dreams has threatened Theros, and only by untangling the strands of destiny can Klothys set things right. The status quo she seeks to restore, however, comes with a cost in mortal casualties and societal upheaval that would accompany this process. She intends to humble the same institutions that condoned or committed these crimes against Theros.

Ephara's ravenous colonization, Iroas's passion for overcoming insurmountable odds, and Karametra's taming of nature all run the risk of inspiring ambitious mortals who lust for ever more power and strain to break away from their proper place in the cosmos.",

Even so, Erebos and Klothys maintain a level of mutual respect. Until recently, Klothys and Athreos were unflappable allies. But now her emergence from the Underworld has blurred the borders between the realms, as she draws horrors into the mortal realm with her and thereby raises Athreos's ire.",

When he does communicate, it is often as a barely audible whisper. Kruphix can speak with a booming voice directly into the minds of all the other gods simultaneously, though, doing so when something threatens the cosmic order.",
						"Kruphix's true form is more abstract than that of any of the other gods. He appears only in star-filled silhouette, usually as a hooded, four-armed figure of indeterminate species and gender. Two of the stars in his \"body\" often shine brightly, suggesting eyes. Kruphix's starry silhouette sometimes takes the form of a bird or a whale.",

								"Perfect understanding is like the horizon: easy to move toward, but impossible to reach. Kruphix knows everything that has ever been known on Theros, so he and only he decides which secrets should be loosed upon the world, and which must be kept forever hidden. He has existed since before mortals occupied Theros and numbers among the few who understand the role of mortal belief in shaping the younger gods—a concept even most gods don't fully comprehend.",
								"Kruphix is the only being who has the ability to seal the borders between the mortal realm and Nyx. He uses this power to safeguard the mortal world from reckless divine meddling and enforce the balance of power among the gods and their faithful.",

He views his fellow gods as petty and vengeful, and he opposes anyone who tries to obtain power that would upset the delicate balance of the pantheon.",
										"Kruphix is the eldest of the gods and sees it as his responsibility to rein in the excesses of his younger siblings. Unlike Heliod, Kruphix knows that he isn't powerful enough to impose his will unilaterally. Instead, he plays the other gods against one another and serves as a mediator in their endless disputes. He takes care to ensure that the other gods view him as impartial, which he considers essential to maintaining his authority."

Chief among the former is the sun god Heliod, whom Kruphix sees as an arrogant, dangerous threat to the balance of power among the gods. He seldom acts against Heliod openly, preferring to warn others about the sun god's efforts to seize power at their expense.",
										"Since every mortal soul must eventually pass beyond the horizon and into death, Kruphix respects both Erebos and Athreos. He sees Erebos as a necessary check on Heliod's power, and he even allowed Athreos to continue his vital work on the fringes of the mortal world when he bound all the other gods within the fabric of Nyx. Erebos and Kruphix blame one another for Klothys's recent emergence from the Underworld, a situation neither seems able to control.",
										"Purphoros loathes Kruphix for temporarily hobbling his mind following an attack against Heliod, but Kruphix holds no grudge against Purphoros. That particular punishment upset the balance too far in the other direction, and Kruphix is more likely to side with Purphoros than Heliod in the future.",
										"Of all the gods, only Klothys truly concerns Kruphix. He hoped that she would remain secret and secluded in the Underworld, and he doesn't know what her emergence portends. She is the only other god whose existence predates mortal belief, and though he is unlikely to draw her ire by manipulating destiny, he doesn't know how her return will affect the pantheon."

The great Silence of the gods serves as the backdrop for numerous tales of heroism and sacrifice. Many alive today witnessed the sky go dark and the temples grow quiet.

The naiad's journey is celebrated in hushed chants as blindfolded initiates are led across a boundary—often stepping into a river or over a low stone wall, an act that symbolizes crossing the horizon. Then the blindfolds are removed as the faithful intone a paean to Kruphix. The hope is that Kruphix will choose to reveal himself at the climax of the ritual, whether by the appearance of some omen or in a personal epiphany. Such a revelation isn't always positive, though, as Kruphix often imparts a glimpse of cosmic truths for which mortals have no possible context."

				"Even though elves live far longer than most other humanoids, they show few physical signs of aging until they become very old. By the time an elf's hair turns to silver and wrinkles appear around the eyes, the elf has lived for centuries and probably has only a few decades remaining. For this longevity and long-lasting vitality, they thank and revere Labelas Enoreth.",
				"Labelas is portrayed as an elderly elf with silver hair, still-active eyes that once were bright blue but now are clouded and gray, fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, and a right hand slightly impaired by the effects of age. If anything, these symptoms of mortality make the god even more handsome and stately in the eyes of his followers than he was in his youth.",
				"Elves tend to give Labelas little regard until they experience Remembrance. Like Corellon and Hanali, Labelas makes few demands on his followers. A few minutes each day spent thanking him for his gift of long life and good health, and occasionally placing a fresh flower in one of his shrines, is generally all that's expected. When an elf develops unusual ailments in old age and appears headed for decrepitude, other elves might wonder if these are the repercussions for not paying Labelas his due.",
				"Most settlements have only one or two priests of Labelas. These individuals are elves well past their prime but who have not yet begun to withdraw into themselves. Their duties involve guiding elves who have recently experienced Remembrance, and are thus beginning the journey into introversion in the waning days of one's mortal life. The priests also preside over funeral celebrations, since Labelas is also honored for his role in seeing that elves experience beneficial reincarnations.",

						" Shrines and temples to Labelas Enoreth are mostly made of or decorated with ephemeral things. Patterns and images made with colored sand, cut flowers, precariously stacked stones, and images made from thin paper are all commonly found there. These places of veneration are usually located in desolate, high places where the ever-changing sky and the setting sun can be seen and contemplated. Along with the setting sun, images of clouds are a major motif for followers of Labelas, who often tattoo such designs on their bodies or embroider them on their robes to signify the ephemeral nature of the physical world.",
						"Labelas Enoreth is the custodian of time, monitoring its passing and making sure that the warp and weft of history isn't torn asunder by powerful maniacs and errant demigods. He is also the eternal witness, watching the souls of the elves as they dance from incarnation to incarnation, each mortal lifetime representing a role an actor would take in a play. From his cosmic perspective, Labelas looks on each elven life as a story to be written, nudging wayward souls toward incarnations that he deems suitable for their overall development, and thus weaving the life of each elven soul into a tapestry that spans the ages. In acknowledgment of this gift, priests and devotees of Labelas often weave modest tapestries of their own and donate them to shines in his honor.",
						"Despite Labelas's influence in the Seldarine, elves can become psychologically immersed in their mortal incarnations, forgetting about the tick of time and the eventual end of their physical forms. Even Labelas's appearance, with his obvious signs of aging, isn't enough to dissuade some elves from growing attached to their youthful features, long life, and worldly treasures. But all such naive behavior is brought to heel when the Remembrance occurs, and an elf's inward examination begins as one journeys toward death and a new beginning. Priests of Labelas smile with compassion when these wide-eyed elves show up at their temples, suddenly full of contrition and offerings for Labelas, still shaken from the vision of their Remembrance and the gravity of its meaning.",
						"To enhance an elf's Remembrance, the priests of Labelas use a special mirror made of polished black onyx. Small versions of these can be seen at many shrines dedicated to the Seldarine, as a reminder to the passing faithful of the importance of Remembrance. The priests advise those in their care to look into the mirror in order to deepen the trance of Remembrance. In the black void of the mirror, they see the faces of their former selves and scenes from their past lives-a glimpse into the grand tapestry of the each soul's existence as Labelas begins to weave yet another incarnation."

				"Though the Master of the Pit is not conscious, neither is he entirely dormant. Mirroring the fate of yuan-ti in the world, Merrshaulk entered a deep slumber when the serpent folk left the surface and went into hiding in ages past. It is unclear if declining worship caused him to fall asleep, or if his prolonged torpor caused his worshipers to abandon him. Even in his compromised state, Merrshaulk grants spells to his clergy in response to their invocations. Rousing him for advice or direct intervention is possible, but requires many ritual murders to be performed in his name, and his return to consciousness lasts only a short time.",

They sense that it has become easier to wake him in recent decades, and believe this to be a sign that he will soon fully awaken, shed his skin, and-renewed by transformation-restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place as masters of the mortal world."

When children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki to protect them until they are found.",
				"Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual deity - less human-like than many other gods. She's not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest she hides in.",

But most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are thought to be boon companions. Mielikki's relationships with other deities of the natural world are more complex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her own path through the wilds.",
				"She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a unicorn's head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the goddess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber cutters safe during the work."

Milil is most venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative endeavor also pray to Milil.",

He is variously depicted as young or old, but his identity is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation.",
				"Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in performance venues and schools of music. Whether the site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts of performance at his shrines and temples.",
				"Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, Milil is the god's left hand, also referred to as the One True Hand. This expression isn't meant to denigrate the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact that left-handedness is more often associated with great artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes from the acceptance of truth."

				"Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals who were raised to deityhood when Jergal grew weary of his divine duties and distributed his influence between them. Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can death itself truly ever die? Myrkul's faithful see him as the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to Kelemvor to be judged.",
				"Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion, dusk, and autumn. He's the god of the ending of things and hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of beginnings and hope. Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and obsessed with the dead and the undead. Like many followers of Kelemvor and Jergal, priests of Myrkul serve as undertakers and typically keep their patron's identity secret.",
				"Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol appear in many places where humans bury their dead, but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles around are brought for internment, even if they were not of Myrkul's faith. There is little space set aside for the living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that throne sits the doomwarden - the preserved corpse of the most revered saint in the history of the temple (often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to kneel before a temple's doomwarden, where they must spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in complete darkness."

Mortals pray to her to ward off unseasonable weather, both natural and supernatural in origin.",

Nylea has personally slain many of those who killed wantonly in her sacred Nessian Wood.",

If it were up to her, she might well wipe away all the poleis and larger communities, leaving only scattered tribes of mortals to live in an enforced balance with nature.

				"Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge. Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge in its most supreme, raw form - the idea. An aphorism cited by his faithful about this concept serves them as a prayer when it is repeated aloud: \"An idea has no heft but it can move mountains. An idea has no authority but it can dominate people. An idea has no strength but it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of the mortal mind, outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything else can exist, the idea must exist.\"",
				"Oghma's faithful spread knowledge and literacy as widely as possible, believing that minds ought never to be shackled by ignorance and thus not be able to bequeath the benefit they might otherwise provide their fellows. Not surprisingly, those who follow Oghma oppose those who foster deceit, trickery, and ignorance.",
				"Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards, cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages, scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, preserve, and create knowledge and learning. The worship of Oghma was, at one point, one of the few organized faiths in Faerûn that had an established orthodoxy and a complete network of temples that adhered to that orthodoxy. Schisms during the Time of Troubles shattered that network, and now the structures that house the faith are individual temples or small networks of allied temples, much in the manner of other faiths."

It isn't altruism that drives her; she studies the innovation and suffering of mortals, deciphering in them ever greater mysteries as she treats Theros as her personal laboratory.",

Her hands are thickly scaled and a pair of bronze-scaled vipers seamlessly emerge from her chest. She is never without her kylix, a drinking cup within which she can produce virtually any medicine or toxin. When her aims require subtlety, Pharika often takes the form of a serpent or a medusa, or sometimes an aged human.",

In some cases, that cost is pain as the medicine courses through the imbiber's body. In other cases, she demands years of life, either from the patient's lifetime or the researcher's labor.",
								"In her oversight of life and death, Pharika acts as a patron of alchemists. Pharmacists offer prayers to her while crafting potions, as do the ill or infirm before imbibing a supposed remedy. Likewise, a body's slow transformation is sacred to her, whether it be the inevitable effects of aging or the petrification of her medusa children's victims.",

Pharika rankles somewhat at the attention Erebos gets from dying mortals, chafing at their tendency to appeal to him when they could beg her for healing or for a painless death.",

He crossed back over the Rivers That Ring the World wrapped in the tattered cloak of Athreos, the River Guide, who ushers the dead to their final rest. Hidden by illusion as he was, neither Athreos nor Erebos could find Phenax and bring him back.",

Whether by feeding the hubris of a champion of Heliod or subverting the moral code of a stalwart of Iroas, he tempts mortals by confronting them with seemingly inconsequential decisions, each of which offers an opportunity for the person to compromise their principles.

Phenax, basking in the chaos of Xenagos's plot, found myriad ways to covertly aid him until the satyr's apotheosis.

Though amusing at first, Phenax's words cut deep, making the hunters careless. Thus, when the dryad suggested a blindfolded test of marksmanship, the hunters agreed. Once blinded, Phenax positioned the hunters to shoot one another. In the moment they fired, though, Nylea noticed Phenax's trick. She curved her hunters' arrows mid-flight and multiplied their number. Phenax's disguise shattered as he was riddled with arrows that pinned him to a great tree. Nylea appeared to the trapped god, mocked his pointless duplicity, and warned him never to threaten her followers again. She then left him to struggle free from the deeply embedded arrows, an escape that took him over a week. During that time, the god concocted plot after plot to have his revenge on Nylea. Some tales claim that this embarrassment directly led to tragedy for Nylea's favorite dryad companion, while others warn that Phenax's revenge has only just begun."

Instead of cursing the situation, Chersio sought a solution, creating a hypocaust system to bring warmth to her community. Delighted with the innovation, Purphoros waited until Chersio completed and lit her substructure furnace. When she did, the god returned warmth to the entire world. Today, an autumnal festival called the Kindling or the Forge-Lighting (the Chalcanapsion) lends its name to the seventh month in the Meletian calendar.

Its roots are so deep and far-reaching that they touch the roots of every other plant in the world, or so it's said. Through this network of tendrils, Rillifane remains aware of everything that happens in the forest.",

They're just as insular and secretive as any other druids, which means their motives are often not clear to those around them.",

At the base of such a tree, amid its immense, gnarled roots, the druids of Rillifane place their offerings. Carvings of animals, golden acorns, snowdrops, and sprigs of holly or witch hazel are all common offerings to the god of the passing seasons and the beasts of the forest. Often a shrine to Rillifane contains resting places where one can bend knee and meditate at the base of the great tree."

Trunks and branches reach high into the expanse of the mind and the realm of revelation, while roots sink deep, anchoring themselves in the known and enwrapping what remains hidden. When Rillifane's druids meditate at the site of a great tree, they can receive visions that afford them a new way of seeing the world. Often these flashes compel the devotee to undertake a quest to bring balance to the natural order by delivering a vital message or completing some other task."

Such individuals can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras was trapped in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and embellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it a welcoming place to stop for a time."

Many non-elves find it easiest to think of Sehanine as the companion of Corellon and the god of the moon, but to elves she is much more than that. The moon passes from one phase to the next, and Sehanine watches over all such cycles, be it from season to season or cradle to grave. She is midwife to elf mothers, ushering souls into the world. She is also thought to stand beside dying elves, to greet their departing spirits and set them on the path to Arvandor. Sehanine serves as patron of the lost and any who travel, as well as those who seek meaning. Elves beseech her to provide relief from madness, and they mark her symbol on graves and tombs to invoke her protection of the dead. In these comforting aspects, Sehanine is often imagined as a willowy, gentle male elf with shining eyes that reveal both melancholy and tenderness in their gaze when depicted alongside his beloved Corellon.",
				"In stories of the Seldarine, Sehanine is Corellon's steadfast companion, the one being who can persuade Corellon to pause and reflect rather than allow his emotions to rule him. Corellon can be resplendent with joy or shaking with anger, but a word or a look from Sehanine is enough to check or subtly alter Corellon's mood and behavior, redirecting the god to a less extreme course of action. Some elven legends treat Sehanine as Corellon's spouse or as a favored child, but other stories hint at a deeper truth. They say Sehanine was formed from the first drop of blood spilled from Corellon's body, and so she reminds Corellon that even as a divine being, he can be harmed.",
				"Sehanine's priests often seek her guidance by entering into a state of true sleep and sifting through their dreams for signs. But Sehanine has another way of sending messages to the elves of the world. The crescent-shaped cataracts that appear in the eyes of an elderly elf at Transcendence are symbolic of the moonbow, an astronomical phenomenon with which she is associated. It appears in the night sky above the moon as a luminous arc of refracted light, no brighter than the moon itself. Only elves and some half-elves can perceive this sign, for it is meant only for Corellon's people. What it signifies depends on the phase of the moon. Above a full moon, when it is most often detected, it means that an elf of great importance and advanced age will soon journey to Arvandor. Elves who see the sign might be compelled to seek out this individual to commune with and learn from before the elder departs the world. The moonbow appearing above the moon during its other phases can be interpreted in many ways, depending on the season and the timing of its appearance. A moonbow appearing above a new moon is the most dreaded sign, for it is said to signal a coming period of great upheaval and many deaths.",

						"Offerings to Sehanine are mostly made from silver, often shaped in a way that is reminiscent of the full moon. Cups, bowls, cloak pins, and plates of silver are found at her shrines, as well as those dedicated to the Seldarine collectively. The weapons and gear used by her followers, such as silver arrowheads, knife blades, and wooden shields, are often decorated with a stylized image of Sehanine's eye with rays coming out of it-a warning to the elves' enemies that Sehanine's gaze has fallen upon them."

But Lolth rarely looses her champion to do her bidding, keeping him snared by unbreakable webs that she removes only in times of direst need.",
				"The dark elves believe that Selvetarm walked in solitude for many centuries, spurning both Lolth and Corellon, for he was not wholly given over to evil but neither was he fully aligned with the forces of light. Eventually his path crossed that of Eilistraee, and he began to appreciate the goodness of the Dark Maiden, as exhibited in her teachings and deeds. By aiding in Selvetarm's redemption, Eilistraee hoped to begin to heal the breach between drow and the Seldarine. That hope was dashed, however, by the insidious plotting of Lolth.",
				"The Queen of Spiders had long resented the existence of Zanassu, a minor demon lord that competed with her for divine authority over spiders. She hated almost as much the possibility of Eilistraee's winning an ally among the drow pantheon. A prime opportunity arose when the spider demon lost much of its power in a conflict on the Material Plane. Lolth convinced Selvetarm to destroy Zanassu in its depleted state and seize the spider demon's burgeoning divine power. She did so by suggesting to Selvetarm that a victory would win him favor in the eyes of Eilistraee, whom he greatly admired. But when Selvetarm prevailed in battle over the spider demon, the wholly evil and chaotic nature of the divine power he absorbed overwhelmed Selvetarm's innate goodness and weakened him enough that the Spider Queen could bound his will tightly to her own.",
				"Enraged by Lolth's duplicity, Selvetarm is an engine of destruction, an eight-limbed maestro of slaughter. If allowed to operate unchecked, he could rend his way through an entire drow city in a berserk rage. Keeping him restrained is one of the few acts of Lolth that can be described as merciful.",
				"Because of his status as a captive, Selvetarm draws little attention from drow of high status. Low-caste drow warriors who are themselves slaves or indentured servants, or who have no chance to rise in rank, can beseech Selvetarm for prowess in battle without suffering any shame. Anyone of high standing or who hopes to attain high standing shies away from openly expressing reverence for Selvetarm, though such an individual might still beg his aid privately."

Priests drawn to serve Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark secrets, which in their minds makes them best suited to console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout the world's history, many followers of Shar have done dark deeds in her name - most notably the shadovar of Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The tragedies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her followers have caused many places to outlaw her worship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but such prohibitions only heighten the priests' umbrage at authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebellion and revenge against whoever rules."

Its expanses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only wasteful but blasphemous.",

The oak leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedicated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies a sacred site."

He promised to lead the yuan-ti away from the brink of defeat and back to the pinnacle of world domination in return for their veneration. Many of Merrshaulk's devout turned to the worship of the Sibilant Death, believing him to be an avatar of their deity. They granted him enough power to mount a brief recovery, but those actions were too little and too late to prevent the collapse of the empire. Sseth chose to rest and gather strength during the years of decline, as more and more of the yuan-ti adopted his worship.",

They strive to succeed by offering an alternative choice to contesting viewpoints or plans, and in so doing they exude an air of self-importance that gives them a less than savory reputation among yuan-ti that follow other gods."

				"Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its forms - not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite pleasures of the flesh, from a lover's caress to the brush of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself.",
				"The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine.",
				"Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune's priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that many take pride in their ability to present themselves as stunningly attractive examples of either gender.",
				"But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's true face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all in the purview of Sune.",
				"Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mirrored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while checking one's appearance. The spot might feature a shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cosmetics so that those without the funds to purchase such items can still make themselves feel beautiful."

Depicted in temple iconography as a withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the varieties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the use of three drops of blood or three tears - to be dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It's common practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image on the homes of the infected.",

Those who favor him see life as a succession of random effects in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they can - for who can say when Talos will strike and send them into the afterlife?",

He is said to carry a collection of three staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three lightning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes.",

He does have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact."

				"Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct during war, using force of arms over talk for settling disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be riding with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who envision him.",
				"Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but over the centuries his priests have made an effort to spread and enforce a common code of warfare - to make war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and professional behavior. This code, called Tempus's Honor, has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself with bravery; train all for battle; and don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all considered sinners.",
				"Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained don't serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given battle, a mortal might be slain or might become a great leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm that civilization brings about by its very existence."

When the infamous explorer Rasiao failed to steal one of Thassa's Tidelock Pearls, wave-controlling treasures protected by vicious mollusks, she spent years avoiding the waves before finding her way back to the mainland. Although she'd failed to abscond with one of Thassa's treasures, she'd avoided the sea god's wrath, a claim she valued more preciously than gold. For years, Rasiao lived far from ocean or river, making her home in the driest reaches of Theros. She lived a long life, but on one trip to Akros to resupply and brag, she drowned in a bowl of ox stew. Those who found Rasiao discovered a pearl, too large to pass her lips, lodged in her mouth. Fearing further reprisal, Rasiao's daughters committed their mother's body to the Deyda River and Thassa's clutches. The explorer's daughters never forgot that just as countless drops make the sea, so too is every raindrop, tear, and cup part of Thassa's domain."

										"According to the teachings of the Kryn and the Umavi who scribe their faith, it is believed that long before the gods of Exandria came to shape this world, there was a time when a single Light came from the dark nothingness. Other lights came into being around them, settling as the stars in the cosmos. This one Light, however, resisted the force that beckoned them to burn like their star-fated brethren. This one Light wanted to understand what they were and chose to wander alone, choosing a different path. This choice led to endless stretches of lonely dark, the voices of the stars silent to the Light that walked away. Lonely, they wandered until they found a cold, dark rock: a world. The Light grew fond of this rock, seeing it as lonely as they were, and embraced it. They sparked a fire within, cracking the surface and giving fiery life to the cold world.",
										"From within the fiery core, the Light began to watch the world change and turn, the chaos giving birth to the first souls: the Primordials. Amazed with their children, the Light wanted to guide them to learn of themselves, which in turn would help the Light discover their own purpose—but the children warred amongst themselves and killed one another, their souls born of the Light becoming lost to the dark beyond. Confused but determined, the Light decided that a time of learning was required, and that a cycle of trial and error must be enacted for their children of chaos to better themselves. Sacrificing a majority of their own essence, the Light created beacons of their own self, crystals of great power that enacted a cycle of rebirth for those who were bound to the Light.",
										"This act exhausted the Light, and they fell into a deep slumber within the core of the world, awaiting a time where the children of their own mind would learn from life to life, through eons of struggle and self-reflection, until the knowledge had matured enough to reassemble them, awaken them, and the children could grant the answer to the question the Light had sought from the very beginning: what are they and what was their purpose? This Light is now referred to by the mortal followers of the Kryn as the Luxon."

Beyond this familiar appearance, four broad, avian wings burst from this ten-foot-tall avatar's back. It was surrounded by a golden light that seemed not to illuminate and saturate the world around it, but make it dimmer, ashy, and washed-out. Yet in this pallid light came a sharpness of perception, as if it were more real than the material world around it. The being appeared in the center of the Qoniira civilization, at the heart of the city of {@book Niirdal-Poc|TDCSR|3|Niirdal-Poc}, and it spoke a single phrase: \"I am the Observer, and I give unto you the Gift.\" Then, it vanished from sight.",

In peace, plan for war.\" \"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies.\"",
				"Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread.",

Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general population, but those who revere her can frequently be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight looks upon with special favor."

Those who favor Torm believe that one's salvation can be found through service, that every failure to perform one's duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm's faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that most human paladins have Torm as their patron.",

White granite, lion statues, and armored figures predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls.",
				"Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and as such his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and true must pause before acting to judge whether their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this principle.",
				"Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The faithful know that all of them will stumble from time to time while following in Torm's footsteps, but Torm's priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to Torm's standards."

(On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both goddesses.) One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it.",

When her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and wandered off to explore the world.",
						"During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful token, which she assumed was a peace overture from Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to her amazement, Lady Luck couldn't pluck the rose from its bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed the rose with bad luck, and the flower's stem broke in her hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. The severed rose stem crept into Tyche's ear and subtly began to rot her from the inside out.",
						"When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear friend, the goddess Selûne, waiting to speak with her. Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the dispute between the two. Selûne wept great tears as she saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and before Tyche could discern her intent, Selûne lashed out with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche's rotted core split down the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to save that which was good and pure in her friend. However, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, and were separated only by the combined efforts of all three visitors.",
						"It is said that Tymora, Tyche's Fair-Haired Daughter, embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while Beshaba, Tyche's Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. Since their birth, the twin aspects of Tyche - Tymora, Lady Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune - have battled each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of nations and as small as the flip of a coin."

Often they wear the colors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves with items that remind others of the sea's dangerous nature - a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped about a human bone, and so on. The preserved hand of a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy object, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea."

				"Many pantheons include in their number a miscreant or an outlier-someone not to be emulated in the customary way, and often an entity whose existence serves as an object lesson and an example of what befalls mortals who conduct themselves the same way. For the gnomes, this niche is filled by Urdlen, also known as the Glutton for its selfish and cruel behavior.",
				"Though the details differ from telling to telling, all gnomes know the story of how Garl banished Urdlen from the Golden Hills because Urdlen refused to go on an important quest. Despite Garl's efforts and the pleas of the rest of the pantheon, Urdlen selfishly refused to set his own interests aside and contribute to the group. Every version of this story ends in some sort of tragedy-perhaps the loss of Gaerdal's hand, the affliction that caused Flandal to need new skin, or the disappearance of Baravar's shadow-and each one concludes with \"And that is why Garl sent Urdlen into exile.\" In tales of his later life, Urdlen is no longer a gnome but has become a greedy and destructive monster, a great blind and hairless mole with iron claws and teeth.",
				"Gnomes believe that Urdlen exerts influence on their lives when they experience jealousy, greed, petulance, or envy. Individuals are more likely to fall prey to these feelings when they don't spend enough time in activities with others, and so tales of Urdlen serve as a somber reminder of the importance of participating in society."

They could see that Urogalan had been deeply affected by his experiences, since he didn't speak for a long time. He merely sat in a white robe with his hound by his side, watching the world go by. When he did speak at last, he told of a place he called the Green Fields, where the halflings' god-heroes live alongside mortals who have passed on, enjoying lush farmland, bright sunshine, and all the comforts of home.",

In acknowledgement of this assertion, halflings look for signs from their departed loved ones. One might be thinking about catching butterflies with his grandmother long ago, when suddenly a butterfly lands on his hand-clear evidence that, as Urogalan promised, she is still looking out for her grandson from beyond the veil of death.",

That heresy, when it is expressed openly, is liable to be savagely crushed by the priestesses of Lolth. So most of Vhaeraun's male followers honor him simply by trying to carve out better lives for themselves, and that activity is tolerated. Even so, adherents of Vhaeraun don't appear in public without wearing masks. This practice exists in part because Vhaeraun is never portrayed unmasked, and partly because anonymity is a wise precaution when one challenges the social structure of the drow in even a small way.",

His silence, too, is part of his punishment, for his tongue was removed for questioning Lolth's orders. Worshipers of Vhaeraun who believe this dogma sometimes ritually scar and silence themselves as signs of their devotion, and then serve as voiceless, masked bodyguards for the matrons of their house."

				"As the patron of assassination, illusions, and lies, Zinzerena personifies cruelty, stealth, misdirection, and survival by any means necessary. In some ways, Malyk is her reflection, and in many interpretations of the age-old stories, the two gods are siblings or lovers. But Zinzerena is more palatable to female drow than Malyk, and she condones the study of arcane magic.",
				"The liturgy of Zinzerena is passed on in the form of folk tales, for her faith has no place among the leadership of drow society. Her tales usually describe her hiding and waiting until her foes are weakened or lax in their attention before she attacks. Those who respect or revere Zinzerena are almost always of modest social status, or worse. Even the most prestigious of noble estates, where a high priestess reigns supreme, might have a number of her followers among the commoners who work as servants and staff. Only the most capricious of nobles would enter her priesthood, though some have done so. Inevitably, when such traitors are discovered, they are cast out from their houses. Ironically, these maverick nobles often become leading figures in Zinzerena's cult, for they are the best educated and most politically experienced of her followers. Her adherents come from a wide range of occupations, including common thieves, laborers, guides, physicians, poets, and nearly any other profession. What they all share is a rebellious spirit and a desire for change.",
				"In some stories, Zinzerena is Lolth's daughter, who was spirited away and hidden from her by illusions. In other tales, she begins life as a mortal elf who uses glamors to trick her way into the company of the gods. Regardless, Zinzerena always has some element of illusion magic about her, and she uses it and other deceptions to get the better of more powerful opponents. Deceit and taking advantage of others' weaknesses are recurring themes in the tales of her exploits. The only figure in the Dark Seldarine immune to Zinzerena's deceptions is Lolth, although even the Queen of Spiders is sometimes tricked when Zinzerena shifts blame for her actions onto others.",
				"Not many female drow devote their lives to the study of magic, because it's held to be a low-status avocation more suited to males. Most females who pursue it seriously do so in secret. Even rumors that a drow matron practices arcane magic, if they aren't quashed, can sabotage her standing in society. Yet there's no denying that knowledge of arcane magic could be a great boon to an ambitious female. Zinzerena's worshipers encourage this pursuit and offer tutelage and tools in exchange for a candidate's alliance with Zinzerena's secret cult."
