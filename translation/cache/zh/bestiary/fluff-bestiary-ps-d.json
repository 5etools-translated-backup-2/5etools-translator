	"The merfolk of Vodalia have waged bitter war for generations against the cryptic, cold-loving crustacean race of (%0%). The surface ocean waters have become too warm for the homarids in recent times, but in the years following the Brothers' War, as a global ice age settled over Dominaria, the homarids swarmed to the surface and nearly unraveled the fabric of the first Vodalian Empire. Even now, these creatures teem in the deep, frigid trenches to the west of the Voda Sea.": "沃达莉亚的人鱼族世世代代都在与隐秘、嗜冷的甲壳类种族（%0%）进行惨烈的战争。近代以来，表层海水对于同形虫来说已经变得过于温暖，但在兄弟战争之后的岁月里，随着全球冰河时期笼罩多米尼克里亚，同形虫蜂拥而至，几乎破坏了第一个沃达利亚帝国的结构。时至今日，这些生物仍在沃达海西部寒冷的深海壕沟中繁衍生息。",
	"Homarids don't seem to understand any language other than (%0%)—and might have only the barest suspicion that the sounds made by other creatures can communicate meaning at all. In their minds, they are the most advanced species on Dominaria, and all others are effectively animals. In the Homarid Wars that coincided with the start of the ice age, the homarids treated their merfolk enemies like cattle, to be slain and then tossed into spawning beds to provide food for homarid hatchlings. However, later historical revision tried to portray the expansionist homarids as victims of the merfolk Empress Galina's aggression.": "除了（%0%）之外，荷马人似乎听不懂其他语言--他们可能只是勉强怀疑其他生物发出的声音能够传达意义。在他们的心目中，他们是多米尼克大陆上最先进的物种，其他生物实际上都是动物。在与冰河时期同时发生的同族战争中，同族人把他们的人鱼敌人当作牲畜一样对待，杀死后扔进产卵床，为同族人鱼幼崽提供食物。然而，后来的历史修正试图将扩张的同族人描绘成人鱼皇后加琳娜侵略的受害者。",
	"A variety of homarid more suited to warm water, called viscerids, lives in less frigid seas, particularly around Yavimaya.": "有一种更适合温暖水域的同形虫，被称为 \"粘虫\"，生活在不太冷的海域，尤其是亚维马亚附近。",
	"Kavu are reptilian creatures that are either very ancient or a relatively recent creation on Dominaria. Either awakening from a millennia-long hibernation or springing fully formed into being, they emerged from the ground to defend against the Phyrexian Invasion. The Llanowar elves now breed the kavu to fill a variety of roles, believing that these creatures were the goddess Gaea's means of intervening in Dominaria's defense. The close relationship between elves and kavu is a constant reminder of Gaea's beneficence. Every Kelfae bonds with an arboreal kavu companion, and some Kelfae and Basiphem warriors ride them into battle.": "卡乌是一种爬行类生物，它们要么是多米尼克里亚非常古老的生物，要么是最近才出现的。它们或是从长达千年的冬眠中苏醒，或是在完全成形后从地底钻出，抵御费雷克斯人的入侵。拉诺瓦精灵现在培育卡乌来扮演各种角色，他们相信这些生物是盖亚女神介入多明尼亚防御的手段。精灵和卡乌之间的密切关系时刻提醒着人们盖亚的恩惠。每个凯尔法精灵都有一个树栖卡乌伙伴，有些凯尔法精灵和巴希姆战士会骑着它们上战场。",
	"The arboreal kavu bred by the Kelfae are capable of climbing sheer surfaces at any angle, and of charging at astonishing speed at ground level. Kelfae warriors ride a large breed of kavu predators, using a series of cloth slings as safety restraints while sitting or dangling from the creature's back. The nimble and acrobatic Kelfae kavu riders are called arborealists.": "凯尔法人培育的树栖卡乌能够以任何角度攀爬峭壁，在地面上也能以惊人的速度冲锋。凯尔法勇士骑着一种大型卡乌掠夺者，使用一系列布制吊索作为安全束缚，坐在或悬挂在掠夺者的背上。敏捷、善于杂技的凯尔发卡武骑手被称为树人。",
	"The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angels—both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.": "塞拉教会最明显和最著名的标志是她的天使--既有塞拉亲自创造的天使，也有自发出现在苏尔西大教堂的天使。有些天使在大教堂里过着沉思的生活，但大多数天使都是信仰的积极捍卫者，在世界各地保护着塞拉的子民。强大的天使通常负责世界上的大片区域。例如，天琴座是贝纳利亚的保护者，沙莱在拉诺瓦也扮演着类似的角色。人们相信塞拉的天使会听到向塞拉发出的祈祷，而且他们有一种不可思议的倾向，就是在需要他们的时候准时到达。",
	"Any of the angels in the (%0%) can serve as (%1%). The (%2%) represents the most common angels, while the (%3%) and (%4%) are appropriate for powerful angels such as (%5%) and (%6%).": "(%0%) 中的任何天使都可以充当 (%1%)。(%2%) 代表最常见的天使，而 (%3%) 和 (%4%) 则适用于强大的天使，如 (%5%) 和 (%6%)。",
	"Though the Basiphem dwell in the highest layer of the forest, they maintain extensive stables on the forest floor to house and train the largest ground-dwelling kavu. Members of the Order of the Steel Leaf often ride these creatures into battle, with the largest of the kavu sometimes reaching the size of elephants.": "虽然巴西姆人居住在森林的最高层，但他们在森林地面上有大量的马厩，用来饲养和训练最大的地栖卡武。钢叶骑士团的成员经常骑着这些生物作战，最大的卡乌有时甚至能达到大象的体型。"
