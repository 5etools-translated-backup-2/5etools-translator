	"A pterosaur the size of the most ancient dragons, an aerosaur boasts a wingspan of nearly 6 metre. Elemental energy traces patterns like lightning across its scales, giving additional thunderous power to the beating of its enormous wings.": "翼龙的体型相当于最古老的龙，翼展接近 6 米。元素能量像闪电一样在它的鳞片上划出一道道花纹，为它巨大翅膀的拍打增添了雷霆万钧的力量。",
	"The altisaur is a titanic sauropod often likened to a walking mountain, with craggy spines, patterns of elemental energy that glow in its hide like streams of lava, and eight massive legs the size of ancient trees. It creates gullies where its tail drags along the ground. Clouds often seem to gather around its head, which can reach as high as 45 metre off the ground.": "坛龙是一种泰坦巨型类人猿，通常被比喻为一座行走的山峰，身上长满了峭壁上的刺，元素能量的图案在它的皮毛上发光，就像熔岩流一样，八条巨大的腿有古树那么粗。它的尾巴拖在地上会形成沟壑。云层似乎经常聚集在它的头部，它的头部离地可高达 45 米。",
	"A Dwarvish saga claims bag jellies are the result of a curse laid by Durgrid Bladeforge, who was beaten to death while hiding inside a giant's bag.": "矮人的一个传说称，袋果冻是 Durgrid Bladeforge 下的诅咒的结果，Durgrid Bladeforge 躲在一个巨人的袋子里被活活打死。",
	"Bag jellies are olive-hued oozes similar to the dungeon scavengers described in the(%0%). As their name suggests, though, these creatures are most often found in the bags carried by giants, where they feed on whatever organic material they find. Bag jellies are resistant to squishing, which helps them survive when a giant throws the bag, sits on it, or uses it as a makeshift bludgeon.": "袋子果冻是一种橄榄色的渗液，类似于（%0%）中描述的地牢清道夫。不过顾名思义，这种生物最常出现在巨人携带的袋子里，它们以找到的任何有机物为食。袋子果冻耐挤压，这有助于它们在巨人扔袋子、坐在袋子上或将袋子用作临时棍棒时存活下来。",
	"Some giants keep their bags scrupulously clean to avoid attracting bag jellies, but others actually use these scavengers to hinder thieves. Many would-be thieves who rummage through a sleeping giant's bag find themselves stuck to a bag jelly's adhesive surface and unable to flee as the sound of their struggle wakes the giant.": "有些巨人为了避免招来袋冻，会把自己的袋子打扫得干干净净，但有些巨人实际上是在利用这些食腐动物来阻止小偷。许多想偷东西的人在翻找熟睡巨人的包时，发现自己被袋果胶粘住了，无法逃走，因为他们的挣扎声会吵醒巨人。",

	"A hill giant who dies with an empty stomach, full of rage and regret, might become suffused with energy from the Negative Plane and rise as a barrowghast. Though it looks like little more than an animated corpse, a barrowghast is filled with necrotic energy and driven by spite and malice. Its blood is a thick and toxic ichor that gives the barrowghast a noxious stench.": "空腹而死的山丘巨人充满愤怒和悔恨，可能会被阴界的能量充斥，变成荒冢怪。虽然它看起来只是一具有生命的尸体，但它充满了坏死的能量，被怨恨和恶意驱使着。它的血液是一种粘稠的有毒黏液，会发出恶臭。",
	"Barrowghasts no longer hunger for physical food and instead crave life energy drained from living creatures. They often target former family members and allies, but they feast indiscriminately on any creatures they encounter. When barrowghasts drain Humanoids' life energy, those Humanoids rise as zombies.": "巴洛格兽不再以肉体食物为食，而是渴求从生物身上吸取生命能量。它们通常以以前的家人和盟友为目标，但也会不分青红皂白地捕食它们遇到的任何生物。当巴洛格兽吸干类人生物的生命能量时，这些类人生物就会变成僵尸复活。",
	"Stone giants believe the god Skoraeus Stonebones inspires artists to create their finest stone carvings. Sometimes a giant pursues this divine inspiration to the exclusion of all other tasks, retreating into a spacious cavern and blocking out all distractions. Creating a masterwork can become such a driving obsession that death can't stop it: a giant who dies while creating art might rise as a cairnwight and continue the work. Once the artwork is completed, the cairnwight remains as its undying guardian.": "石巨人相信，斯科莱厄斯-石骨神（Skoraeus Stonebones）会启发艺术家们创作出最精美的石雕。有时，巨人为了追寻神的灵感，不惜放弃所有其他工作，躲进宽敞的洞穴，排除一切干扰。创作一件杰作可能会让巨人痴迷到无法自拔的地步：巨人在艺术创作过程中死去后，可能会以穴居人的身份复活并继续创作。一旦艺术品完成，穴居人就会成为其不朽的守护者。",
	"A cairnwight looks much like an emaciated stone giant. Its form is caked with lichens and mineral deposits, which help it blend with its cavern tomb. Should a creature attempt to interfere with the completion of the cairnwight's project, damage the art, or steal from the cairnwight, the giant petrifies the creature, places the resulting statue outside as a warning, then reseals its cavern vault.": "穴居人看起来很像一个憔悴的石巨人。它的体表覆盖着地衣和矿物质沉积物，这有助于它与洞穴坟墓融为一体。如果有生物试图干扰穴居人完成工程、破坏艺术品或偷窃穴居人的东西，巨人就会将生物石化，将石化后的雕像放在外面以示警告，然后重新封上洞穴穹顶。",
	"Stretching over 6 metre from the tip of its enormous nose horn to the end of its spiky tail, a ceratops gleams with lines of vibrant green energy in its thickly scaled hide. Its horn alone is larger than most giants, and the ceratops can trample ancient forests under its feet when it becomes enraged.": "从巨大的鼻角尖端到尖尖的尾巴末端，角龙的身长超过 6 米，厚厚的鳞皮上闪烁着一排排生机勃勃的绿色能量。单是它的角就比大多数巨人都要大，当它被激怒时，可以将古老的森林踩在脚下。",
	"Cinder hulks are distant descendants of fire giants who isolated themselves from the world and steeped themselves in the energy of the Elemental Planes. Over the course of centuries, these giants were transformed into Elementals made of smoke and cinders.

	"Cinder hulks live in isolated enclaves in fiery locations on the Material Plane, in the Elemental Planes of Air and Fire, and especially in the Great Conflagration, the border region between those two planes. They retain none of the skills and motivation of their giant ancestors; they simply want to burn as much as they can until their own flames are extinguished. When a cinder hulk dies, it collapses into a billowing cloud of searing smoke.": "煤渣大块头生活在物质位面、元素位面（空气和火焰）的火热地带，尤其是这两个位面的交界处--大燃烧地带，与世隔绝。它们完全没有巨人祖先的技能和动力；它们只想尽可能多地燃烧，直到自己的火焰熄灭。当煤渣绿巨人死亡时，它就会倒下，化为一团团灼热的烟雾。",
	"Cloud giants rise in the ordning by amassing valuable and beautiful treasures—often by gambling. While many cloud giants are content with risking their wealth in games with each other, those who aim for the top of their ordning challenge all manner of beings in games of chance and wit. A destiny gambler is a cloud giant who has won increasingly high-stakes wagers against other giants, smaller folk, and even beings from the Outer Planes.": "云巨人通过积累价值连城的美丽宝藏--通常是通过赌博--来提升自己的地位。许多云巨人只满足于在彼此间的博弈中拿自己的财富冒险，而那些志在登顶的云巨人则在机会和智慧的博弈中挑战形形色色的生物。命运赌徒是指在与其他巨人、小人物甚至外星球生物的赌局中赢得越来越多高额赌注的云巨人。",

	"Years of successful wagers make destiny gamblers so confident in their ability to win any challenge that they invite potential rivals to name the terms of a wager. Those who are foolish enough to issue a combat challenge quickly find these giants' magical prowess is nearly unmatched.": "多年的成功赌注让命运赌徒们对自己赢得任何挑战的能力充满信心，以至于他们邀请潜在的对手说出赌注的条件。那些愚蠢到发出战斗挑战的人很快就会发现，这些巨人的魔法能力几乎无人能及。",
	"Given their inherent link to elemental air, cloud giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning often gravitate to the service of Yan-C-Bin, Prince of Evil Air. These giants' cunning, charisma, and sheer physical and magical might make them well suited to leadership positions in the cults of Elemental Evil. A cult with a cloud giant at its head can be a formidable force of corruption and destruction in the world. As if that weren't enough, cloud giants often bring tremendous wealth with them, swelling the cult's coffers to finance more far-reaching operations.": "鉴于他们与空气元素的内在联系，从奥德宁之神那里叛变的云巨人通常会投靠邪气王子炎丙。这些巨人的狡猾、魅力以及纯粹的身体和魔法力量使他们非常适合在邪恶元素邪教中担任领导职务。一个以云巨人为首的邪教组织可以成为世界上一股强大的腐败和破坏力量。如果这还不够，云巨人通常还会带来巨大的财富，使邪教的金库膨胀，为更深远的行动提供资金。",

	"A slumbering scion of Memnor appears as a dense, slowly drifting tower of clouds that never dissipates. Often, this cloud lingers over a remote valley, creating a constantly overcast sky. Sapient creatures who live beneath this cloud often display superstitious and duplicitous behavior, almost unconsciously leaving gifts for \"rain spirits\" while playing mischievous pranks on each other.": "沉睡中的梅姆诺子孙就像一座浓密的云塔，缓缓飘荡，永不消散。这片云经常萦绕在偏远的山谷上空，形成一片阴云密布的天空。生活在这片云层下的智慧生物经常表现出迷信和两面派的行为，他们几乎会不自觉地为 \"雨灵 \"留下礼物，同时互相恶作剧。",

	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Memnor emerges from the dissipating cloud, often laughing as if it just heard a great joke. Incredibly tall and lanky, the scion towers 22.5 metre tall and wields a morningstar made from magically dense clouds.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，梅姆诺的后裔就会从消散的云层中出现，它经常大笑不止，仿佛刚刚听到了一个天大的笑话。梅姆诺的子孙高大瘦长，身高 22.5 米，手持由神奇的浓云制成的晨星。",
	"It tends to regard other creatures as toys rather than serious threats, and it uses its illusion magic to manipulate creatures into fighting each other. If seriously threatened, it wields thunder and wind to demolish its enemies.": "它往往把其他生物当作玩具，而不是严重威胁，它用幻术操纵生物互相厮杀。如果受到严重威胁，它就会施展雷和风来摧毁敌人。",
	"A scion of Surtur slumbering at the peak of a volcano causes an unending plume of smoke to rise, sometimes lit from below by fiery bursts of lava. As the scion dreams of battle—perhaps a battle to rouse Annam from seclusion by uniting the giants or a war to conquer all in Surtur's name—the volcano rumbles and spews molten rage.": "沉睡在火山顶峰的苏图尔后裔会升起无尽的浓烟，有时还会从下方喷出炽热的熔岩。当子孙梦见战斗--也许是通过联合巨人唤醒安南的战斗，也许是以苏尔特尔之名征服一切的战争--火山就会隆隆作响，并喷出熔浆。",
	"If intruders disturb its resting place, the fire scion's cradle rises as a bipedal juggernaut of molten rock. Sometimes miners risk their lives to find rich veins of ore in a scion's volcano, or misguided fire cultists offer sacrifices meant to appease or awaken the volcano, and the awakened cradle defies all their expectations. Like a living volcano, the cradle hurls balls of magma at intruders, exhales fiery gases, and causes molten stone to erupt from the ground around it.": "如果闯入者打扰了它的安息之地，火之子孙的摇篮就会升起，成为熔岩的双足巨兽。有时，矿工会冒着生命危险在子孙火山中寻找丰富的矿脉，或者误入歧途的火焰崇拜者会献上祭品来安抚或唤醒火山，而被唤醒的摇篮会打破他们所有的期望。就像一座活生生的火山，摇篮向入侵者投掷岩浆球，呼出炽热的气体，并使周围的地面喷出熔岩。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Surtur inside it awakens. Standing 18 metre tall, the scion's form is shrouded in a continual cloud of billowing ash and smoke. The awakened scion forms a blade of lava in its mighty hand and schemes to resume its ancient campaigns of conquest, preferably at the head of a fire giant army.": "如果摇篮被毁，里面的苏尔特尔后裔就会苏醒。苏尔图尔的子孙高达 18 米，它的身形被笼罩在一团不断翻滚的灰烬和烟雾之中。苏醒后的苏图尔子孙会在其强大的手中形成一把熔岩之刃，并计划重新开始其古老的征服战役，最好是率领一支火巨人军队。",
	"A slumbering scion of Thrym encased in its cradle is functionally identical to a glacier or iceberg, nestled in an alpine valley or drifting in a polar sea. In its wintry seclusion, the scion dreams of battle and glory.": "沉睡在摇篮中的特瑞姆后裔在功能上与冰川或冰山相同，它们依偎在高山峡谷中或漂流在极地海洋中。在凛冽的寒风中，子嗣梦想着战斗和荣耀。",
	"If it is disturbed, the scion's cradle animates as a bipedal figure formed of ice and snow. It smashes intruders with its icy fists or hurls shards of its own icy substance at them, and it can exhale a blast of frigid air to freeze foes in place.": "如果受到干扰，子孙的摇篮就会变成一个由冰雪组成的双足人形。它能用冰冷的拳头击碎入侵者，或向他们投掷自己的冰雪碎片，还能呼出一股寒冷的空气，将敌人冻结在原地。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, its icy body shatters to reveal the awakened scion of Thrym inside it. Forming a double-bladed axe in its hand, the 21-metre-tall scion rushes at any foe that dares to challenge it. Emulating sagas of Thrym, the scion can achieve a tremendous feat of strength: creating a glacier in the ground and hurling it skyward, along with any creatures standing on it.": "如果摇篮被毁，其冰冷的躯体就会碎裂，露出里面苏醒的瑟姆子孙。21 米高的子孙手握双刃斧，冲向任何敢于挑战它的敌人。仿效特瑞姆的传奇故事，子孙可以发挥出巨大的力量：在地面上形成冰川，然后将冰川连同站在冰川上的任何生物一起抛向天空。",
	"A slumbering scion of Grolantor is often mistaken for a hill, and sometimes people erect standing stones, a village, or a city on a scion's back, unaware of the mighty power beneath them. Such settlements can thrive for centuries, as the scion's magic causes crops to flourish and livestock to thrive in the surrounding region. An ancient tree towers from the crest of the hill.": "沉睡中的格罗兰托子孙常常被误认为是一座小山，有时人们会在子孙的背上竖起石头、村庄或城市，却不知道它们下面蕴藏着强大的力量。由于子嗣的魔力会使周围地区的农作物和牲畜茁壮成长，因此这些定居点可以繁荣数百年。山顶上耸立着一棵古树。",
	"When roused, a cradle of the hill scion rises as a mass of dirt, stone, and roots with two massive arms. The cradle uses tree roots and waves of dirt to entangle and entomb foes.": "当被唤醒时，一个由泥土、石头和树根组成的山丘子孙摇篮会以两只巨大的手臂升起。摇篮会利用树根和泥土浪花缠住并困住敌人。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Grolantor inside it awakens. Standing 15 metre tall, the scion devours everything within reach to satiate its hunger. Its powerful lungs can suck food straight into its gullet. The scion uses a great tree to bat foes far into the distance.": "如果摇篮被毁，里面的格罗兰托后裔就会苏醒。它身高 15 米，能吞噬一切触手可及的东西来充饥。它强大的肺部能将食物直接吸进肚里。子孙用一棵大树将敌人击飞到很远的地方。",
	"A scion of Skoraeus typically slumbers deep in the heart of a towering mountain, almost becoming one with the earth. While the scion dreams, the mountain's minerals are transformed into fine carving stones and brilliant gems.": "斯科莱厄斯的后裔通常沉睡在一座高山的深处，几乎与大地融为一体。当后裔入梦时，山中的矿物质就会转化为精美的雕刻石和璀璨的宝石。",
	"If a miner tunnels too close to the heart of the mountain, the cradle awakens as a bipedal mass of stone and crystals. It brings the weight of the mountain down on the intruder's head and unleashes an earsplitting roar that can collapse mine tunnels.": "如果矿工挖的坑道太靠近山的中心，摇篮就会苏醒，变成一个由石头和水晶组成的两足动物。它将大山的重量压在入侵者的头上，并发出震耳欲聋的轰鸣声，能让矿道坍塌。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Skoraeus inside it awakens. At nearly 21 metre tall, it towers over most other creatures and wields a mass of crystal as a club. Once awakened, the scion continues to pursue the art that ornamented its dreams, seeking to mold and shape stone into beautiful elegance. If it needs more raw materials, the scion can transform a living creature in its palm into stone.": "如果摇篮被毁，里面的斯科拉俄斯后裔就会苏醒。它身高将近 21 米，比其他大多数生物都要高大，并挥舞着一大块水晶作为棍棒。一旦苏醒，它就会继续追求它梦想中的艺术，努力将石头塑造成美丽优雅的造型。如果需要更多的原材料，子孙可以将掌中的生物变成石头。",
	"A scion of Stronmaus often slumbers high in the sky or deep in the ocean, where the tumult caused by the scion's restless sleep has little effect on the world. If it drifts too near the ground or the ocean surface, it causes mighty storms or fierce maelstroms. A scion's slumber is filled with dreams ranging from inspiring visions of Annam's return to melancholy prophecies of inevitable decline, from joyful glimpses of an idyllic past to horrific nightmares of torment and devastation.": "斯特朗默斯的子嗣经常在高空或深海中沉睡，子嗣不安稳的睡眠所引起的骚动对世界影响不大。如果它飘到离地面或海面太近的地方，就会引起强大的风暴或剧烈的漩涡。子孙沉睡时会做很多梦，有的梦见安南的回归，有的梦见衰落的预言，有的梦见田园诗般的过去，有的梦见恐怖的噩梦，有的梦见折磨和毁灭。",
	"A cradle of the storm scion stirs into action not only when the scion is threatened but also if the scion's sleep is troubled by nightmares. When roused, the cradle takes on a vaguely giant-shaped form consisting of air, water, and ice whirling in fury.": "风暴子孙的摇篮不仅会在子孙受到威胁时唤醒子孙，而且还会在子孙被噩梦困扰而无法入睡时唤醒子孙。当被唤醒时，摇篮会呈现出一个隐约的巨大形状，由空气、水和冰组成，在狂怒中旋转。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Stronmaus inside it awakens. Among the mightiest creatures of all giantkind, the scion stands 24 metre tall. It often finds some relief in waking and being freed from its troubling dreams, so it doesn't necessarily lash out in violence when emerging from its cradle. But it's not particularly interested in Humanoids or other little creatures—either in conversing with them or in protecting them from harm it might cause.": "如果摇篮被毁，里面的斯特朗默斯的子孙就会苏醒。作为所有巨人中最强大的生物，子孙高达 24 米。它通常会在醒来后从烦恼的梦境中解脱出来，因此在从摇篮中醒来时并不一定会使用暴力。但它对类人或其他小生物并不特别感兴趣--无论是与它们交谈，还是保护它们免受自己可能造成的伤害。",
	"If the scion is threatened, it unleashes elemental might like few other forces in the multiverse can muster: blades of lightning, boulder-sized hailstones, and a storm of churning elements.": "如果子孙受到威胁，它就会释放出多元宇宙中少有的元素威力：闪电、巨石大小的冰雹和汹涌的元素风暴。",
	"Death giant reapers wield massive scythes and wear armor that resembles the carapaces of giant insects. They wield the magic of shadow, which lets them take on a ghastly appearance and disappear, as well as twist shadow into terrifying bolts of energy that drain the vigor of their victims.": "死亡巨人收割者挥舞着巨大的镰刀，穿着类似巨型昆虫甲壳的盔甲。他们能施展阴影魔法，让自己变成可怕的样子并消失，还能将阴影扭曲成可怕的能量弹，耗尽受害者的生命力。",
	"A death giant shrouded one has learned the secrets of death magic—some say from the Raven Queen herself. A shrouded one collects the skulls of fallen kin and inscribes the death rune on a prized skull from this grisly collection. Abandoning armor in favor of gloomy robes, the shrouded one uses rune magic to create a shadowy scythe blade at the end of a staff and to conjure an aura of tormented souls for protection.": "死亡巨人 \"裹尸布 \"学会了死亡魔法的秘密--有人说是乌鸦女王亲自传授的。裹尸者收集死去亲人的头骨，并在其中珍贵的头骨上刻下死亡符文。裹尸者放弃了盔甲，转而穿上了阴暗的长袍，他使用符文魔法在法杖的末端打造出一把朦胧的镰刀，并召唤出受苦灵魂的光环来保护自己。",
	"Long ago, a large band of cloud giants traveled to the Shadowfell in search of a way to preserve their collapsing empire. Desperate to save themselves and their way of life, they collectively made a bet with the Raven Queen, a mysterious god of death and memory who dwells on that plane. Accounts of that bet and its outcome vary: some say the Raven Queen answered every riddle the giants posed until the giants collapsed from exhaustion, while others describe a series of increasingly improbable events favoring the Raven Queen in every wager. What is certain is that the giants severely underestimated the Raven Queen. When they lost their wager, the Shadowfell became their home, and they have grudgingly served the Raven Queen ever since.": "很久以前，一大群云巨人来到暗影大陆，寻找保存他们即将崩溃的帝国的方法。为了拯救自己和他们的生活方式，他们集体与乌鸦女王打赌，乌鸦女王是居住在暗影星的一位神秘的死亡与记忆之神。关于这场赌局及其结果的说法不一：有人说乌鸦女王回答了巨人提出的每一个谜语，直到巨人精疲力竭倒下；也有人描述了一系列越来越不可能发生的事件，每次赌局都对乌鸦女王有利。可以肯定的是，巨人严重低估了乌鸦女王。当他们输掉赌局后，暗影之城就成了他们的家，从那时起，他们就勉为其难地为乌鸦女王服务。",
	"Over time, the Shadowfell transformed these giants; their bodies shriveled, and their complexions took on a deep-purple hue. They became the first death giants, and their descendants haunt the Shadowfell to this day, searching both that plane and the Material Plane for souls that might please their divine queen.": "随着时间的推移，暗影之城改变了这些巨人；他们的身体变得干瘪，肤色呈现深紫色。他们成为了第一批死亡巨人，他们的后代至今仍在暗影狱出没，在暗影狱和物质位面寻找可以取悦他们神圣女王的灵魂。",
	"Most giants know better than to make regular use of the death rune.": "大多数巨人都知道最好不要经常使用死亡符文。",

	"When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.": "当安纳姆的孩子们刚刚开始在物质位面的世界里繁衍生息时，万物之父创造了巨型恐龙，作为他们的伙伴与他们一起生活。创造恐龙时使用的原始魔法至今仍在它们体内涌动，并在它们高大的身体上显现出五彩斑斓的疤痕状纹路。其中一些远古恐龙依然生活在永恒的丛林、隐秘的飞地和其他未被世人触及的土地上。",
	"Dust hulks are descended from enclaves of stone giants who lived in extreme environments, isolated from others. Elemental energy from the Plane of Air eroded their physical forms and slowly transformed them into Elementals.

When a dust hulk dies, it disperses into a cloud of dust.": "尘土绿巨人是生活在极端环境中、与世隔绝的石巨人的后裔。来自空气界的元素能量侵蚀了他们的身体形态，并慢慢将他们转化为元素生物。他们只是一团碎石和尘埃，几乎无法保持凝聚的形态。当灰尘绿巨人死亡时，它会化为一团灰尘消散。",
	"Dust hulks retain their ancestors' passion for artistry, but instead of carving stone, they view their bodies as living works of art. As they fly, coursing along wind currents or blowing through underground tunnels like living sandstorms, they create mesmerizing dances with their ever-shifting forms.": "灰尘大块头保留了祖先对艺术的热情，但他们不再雕刻石头，而是将自己的身体视为活生生的艺术品。当它们沿着风流飞行，或像活沙暴一样吹过地下隧道时，它们用不断变换的形态创造出令人着迷的舞蹈。",
	"It's tempting to view the various hulks as symbols of the long, slow decline of the giants as a people. But that's hardly fair to the giants who still survive and thrive in the world, heirs of tremendous glory.": "我们很容易将各种废墟视为巨人作为一个民族长期、缓慢衰落的象征。但这对那些仍在世界上繁衍生息的巨人来说并不公平，他们是巨大荣耀的继承者。",

Those who prove exceptionally valuable to Demogorgon's purposes in the Material Plane are rewarded with a \"blessing\" that transforms them into monstrous echoes of their demon patron.": "一些传说称，最早的埃廷人是被恶魔王子德摩戈尔贡改造的兽人，而另一些传说则将他们的起源与格罗兰托或其他奥丁之神联系在一起。无论起源的真相如何，艾丁人有时会在双头德摩戈尔刚身上找到同类的灵魂，并投身为他服务。那些在物质界对德莫戈贡有特殊价值的人，会得到一种 \"祝福\"，这种祝福会将他们变成恶魔守护神的怪物。",
	"The arms of an echo of Demogorgon transform into powerful tentacles, and the heads take on a more bestial appearance. The transformation leaves the echo frenzied with rage; the two heads shout and howl at each other with a fury that resounds with demonic magic, sowing discord and confusion around them. As the echo's monstrous heads roar and bite at each other, nearby creatures are racked with psychic pain or join in the ruckus, attacking their allies.": "德摩戈尔贡回声的手臂变成了强有力的触手，头部则呈现出更加兽化的外观。变身让回声兽狂怒不已；两个头颅互相嘶吼和嚎叫，带着恶魔魔法的愤怒，在周围散播着不和谐和混乱。当回声的怪物头颅相互咆哮和撕咬时，附近的生物会感到精神痛苦，或者加入骚乱，攻击它们的盟友。",
	"Mind flayers, which are described in the(%0%), are created through ceremorphosis, a process that begins with the implantation of an illithid tadpole in the brain of a Humanoid host. Mind flayers have subjected giants to this process in an effort to create larger, stronger mind flayers, but those experiments all ended in failure: a giant's body is simply too large for a single tadpole to take over. Ettins, however, proved to be perfect subjects. An ettin's two brains provide sufficient food for two tadpoles, and the two tadpoles are able to transform the entirety of the ettin's body, creating an ettin ceremorph. As part of the transformation process, one of the ettin's heads sinks into the body, with that brain focused on controlling the body. The other head focuses on cogitation and psionic power, though its power is not as great as a mind flayer's.": "(%0%)中描述的 \"夺心魔 \"是通过 \"蜕变 \"创造出来的。\"蜕变 \"过程的第一步是将伊利提德蝌蚪植入类人宿主的大脑。意念剥离者曾让巨人经历这一过程，试图制造出更大更强的意念剥离者，但这些实验都以失败告终：巨人的身体太大，一只蝌蚪根本无法接管。然而，埃廷却是完美的实验对象。艾汀的两个大脑为两只蝌蚪提供了充足的食物，两只蝌蚪能够改造艾汀的整个身体，创造出艾汀蜕皮虫。作为改造过程的一部分，ettin 的一个脑袋会沉入身体，这个脑袋主要负责控制身体。另一个头则专注于思考和幻象能力，不过它的能力没有心灵剥离者那么强大。",

They can also issue a baleful curse in their final moments.": "一些芬斯基尔人在伊斯加德生活了至少一千年后会发生转变。它们在贪得无厌的饥饿驱使下迅速长到 7.5 米高。这些芬希尔吞噬者利用自己巨大的体型和力量压倒敌人。它们还能在最后时刻发出邪恶的诅咒。",
	"Fensir skirmishers boast great skill in battle, honed over centuries of endless conflict on the battlefields of Ysgard. They also wield elemental magic of earth and stone. True to their giant heritage, they can transform even a pinch of mud or gravel into a boulder suitable for hurling, and the thrown stone grows in flight to knock its target flat on impact.": "芬瑟小兵拥有高超的战斗技巧，这是在伊斯加德战场上数百年无休止的冲突中磨练出来的。他们还能施展土石元素魔法。秉承巨人的传统，他们甚至可以将一撮泥土或砾石变成适合投掷的巨石，投掷出去的石头会在飞行过程中不断变大，在撞击目标时将其击平。",
	"Long ago, a band of frost giants led trolls in a campaign to win Annam's favor by conquering the outer plane of Ysgard. The campaign's aspirations of conquest quickly failed, but the raiders discovered a key feature of Ysgard: creatures slain on that plane return to life the next dawn. Thus, the giants' incursion became a part of the eternal battle that rages across the plane. The trolls, whose fundamental nature was altered by constant regeneration and rebirth amid the energy of Ysgard, slowly changed into entirely new creatures: fensirs.": "很久以前，一队冰霜巨人率领巨魔发动了一场征服伊斯加德外层位面的战役，以赢得安南的青睐。征服的愿望很快就落空了，但突袭者们发现了伊斯加德的一个重要特征：在这个位面被杀死的生物会在第二天黎明复活。因此，巨人的入侵成为了肆虐整个位面的永恒之战的一部分。巨怪在伊斯加德的能量中不断再生和重生，改变了他们的基本属性，慢慢变成了全新的生物：芬斯尔。",
	"Fensirs' troll ancestry is hardly apparent in their appearance. They retain prominent noses and a hint of green in their skin but otherwise resemble relatively small frost or stone giants. They use armor and weapons similar to what other combatants on Ysgard use in the eternal battle.": "芬瑟尔的巨魔祖先在他们的外表上几乎看不出来。他们保留了突出的鼻子和一丝绿色的皮肤，除此之外，他们就像相对较小的霜巨人或石巨人。他们使用的盔甲和武器与伊斯加德其他战士在永恒之战中使用的类似。",
	"The transformation that created fensirs left them with an odd quirk to their regenerative powers: their regeneration doesn't function in sunlight, and in fact, sunlight can turn these creatures to stone.": "产生芬塞尔的转变给它们的再生能力留下了一个奇怪的怪癖：它们的再生能力在阳光下不起作用，事实上，阳光能把这些生物变成石头。",
	"Bringing trolls to a place where nothing ever truly dies seems like a transparently bad idea. What were those giants thinking?": "把巨怪带到一个没有真正死亡的地方，这显然是个坏主意。那些巨人到底在想什么？",
	"And yet, can we fairly say that the existence of fensirs is \"transparently bad\"? Some might argue they are a significant improvement over trolls. At the very least, the diversity of life in the multiverse increased, and new wonders were revealed. That's only bad if you think a small universe that fits within your narrow understanding is good.": "然而，我们能说芬瑟的存在是 \"明显的坏事 \"吗？有些人可能会说，与巨怪相比，它们是一种重大进步。至少，多元宇宙中生命的多样性得到了增加，新的奇迹得以展现。如果你认为一个符合你狭隘理解的小宇宙是好的，那才是坏的。",
	"Like giant priests of Hiatea, firbolgs who serve her fall into two distinct roles that parallel Hiatea's dual nature. At home, primeval wardens tend the hearths and tutor the young. Primeval wardens who patrol the borders of firbolg communities are fierce hunters who guard against external threats and incursions.": "与希阿忒亚的巨型祭司一样，为希阿忒亚服务的冷杉人也有两种不同的角色，这与希阿忒亚的双重性格是一致的。在家里，原始守护者负责照料炉灶和教育孩子。原始守护者则在冷杉人社区的边界巡逻，他们是凶猛的猎手，负责防范外来威胁和入侵。",

	"Firbolgs are often drawn to the service or emulation of the gods Diancastra and Hiatea. Firbolgs' innate magic of obscurement and trickery resonates with Diancastra's wily resourcefulness. A traditional emphasis on community and harmony leads many firbolgs to pledge themselves to Hiatea's service.": "菲尔博尔斯人经常被吸引去侍奉或效仿戴安卡斯特拉神（Diancastra）和希阿塔神（Hiatea）。冷杉人与生俱来的遮蔽和诡计魔法与戴安卡斯特拉的狡猾机智产生了共鸣。对社区与和谐的传统强调让许多菲尔博尔格人承诺为希阿提阿服务。",
	"A fire giant who masters traditional rune magic can control the heat of a volcanic environment and conjure raw elemental energy of fire and magma. In a fire giant community, these forgecallers oversee both forges and the community's defense, often in Surtur's name. Some forgecallers prefer to live and work in isolation, seeking the hottest fires in volcanoes' hearts or the Elemental Plane of Fire to pursue their own crafts and studies.": "掌握传统符文魔法的火巨人可以控制火山环境的热量，并召唤出火和岩浆的原始元素能量。在火巨人社区中，这些召唤者通常以苏尔特尔的名义监督锻造和社区防御。有些锻造师喜欢与世隔绝的生活和工作，他们在火山之心或火元素界寻找最炙热的火焰，追求自己的技艺和研究。",
	"A forgecaller is a walking furnace, clad head to toe in plate armor that seems to barely contain intense heat and billowing smoke. They conjure waves of magma and can fly by jetting magical fire from their legs and body.": "伪召者是一个行走的熔炉，从头到脚都穿着板甲，似乎几乎无法抑制强烈的热量和滚滚浓烟。他们能变出岩浆波，还能从腿部和身体喷射魔法火焰飞行。",
	"A fire giant is born around flame, works with flame, and lives among flames, but a fire giant who gazes into flames too deeply may see the Prince of Evil Fire, Imix, gazing back. Giants who fall to Imix's corruption might leave their homes to join with likeminded cultists, but others remain within their communities to pursue Imix's destructive agenda.": "火巨人围绕火焰而生，与火焰打交道，生活在火焰之中，但如果火巨人过于深情地凝视火焰，就可能会看到邪火王子伊米克斯的回眸。落入伊米克斯魔爪的巨人可能会离家出走，加入志同道合的邪教组织，但也有一些巨人会留在自己的社区，继续伊米克斯的破坏计划。",
	"A fire giant of Evil Fire forges a set of armor and weapons in flames blessed by Imix. The giant can then call on these magical flames to strike the foes of the Eternal Flame. The armor forged in these flames welds to the flesh, so while the giant isn't burned, the armor can't be removed once donned. When the giant dies, the armor explodes as a final gift from the All-Consuming Fire.": "邪火巨人用伊米克斯祝福过的火焰锻造出一套盔甲和武器。巨人可以召唤这些魔法火焰来攻击永恒火焰的敌人。在这些火焰中锻造的盔甲会与肉体焊接在一起，因此虽然巨人不会被烧伤，但盔甲一旦穿上就无法脱下。巨人死后，铠甲会爆炸，作为万物之火的最后礼物。",
	"To my mind, the fire hellion perfectly illustrates the difference between natural fire and the corrupt flames of the Nine Hells.": "在我看来，火阎罗完美地诠释了自然之火与九层地狱的腐败火焰之间的区别。",
	"Fire giants study war in its many forms across the multiverse, which sometimes leads the giants to a fascination with the Blood War—the endless conflict between demons and devils across the Lower Planes.

	"Over time, the giant is corrupted, becoming a Fiend in its own right. The devil teaches the giant how to forge with infernal iron and hellfire, enabling the giant to craft weapons that can funnel the souls of the slain to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. In this way, the devil stands to gain a constant supply of souls from the giant's enemies, as well as the promise that the giant will serve the devil as a smith in the Nine Hells after death.": "随着时间的推移，巨人逐渐堕落，变成了一个恶魔。恶魔教巨人如何用地狱铁和地狱火锻造武器，使巨人能够制造出能将被杀之人的灵魂输送到九层地狱第一层--阿弗纳斯的武器。这样，魔鬼就能源源不断地从巨人的敌人那里获得灵魂，并承诺巨人死后将在九层地狱中为魔鬼当铁匠。",

	"During the dawn of the giants' empires, twisted minds sought to make their fallen comrades continue their service.

	"Before their banishment to the Underdark, fomorians ordered themselves based on achievements of knowledge and magical power. Before Karontor urged his descendants into an ill-fated assault against the Feywild, some of the most ambitious, inquisitive, and power-hungry fomorians felt they had already learned all they could from the Material Plane, and they departed to the Inner Planes, where they could continue their journeys of knowledge unopposed.": "在被放逐到幽暗世界之前，弗莫瑞人根据知识和魔法力量的成就来安排自己的生活。在卡隆托尔怂恿他的后裔对费奥德发动命运多舛的进攻之前，一些最有野心、最好奇、最渴望力量的弗莫瑞亚人认为他们已经从物质界学到了他们所能学到的一切，于是他们离开了物质界，来到了内层界，在那里他们可以继续他们的求知之旅，而不会受到任何阻挠。",
	"In their arrogance, these fomorian nobles unknowingly escaped the dreadful fate of their kin, and they remain unchanged in their remote enclaves. Occasionally they return to the Material Plane to survey the world they left. With angular features and apparently ageless faces, these fomorians resemble gigantic elves.": "这些福莫里亚贵族傲慢自大，在不知情的情况下逃过了同族的可怕命运，他们在偏远的飞地中一成不变。偶尔，他们也会回到物质界，看看他们离开的世界。这些弗莫瑞人五官棱角分明，面容明显不老，就像巨大的精灵。",

	"Some fomorians search for the arcane glory their kind possessed before their banishment into the Underdark. They forge magical pacts with entities of the dark—perhaps powerful Fey of the Gloaming Court or eldritch entities buried deep in the Underdark. Their pacts give these fomorians power over shadows, allowing them to mold and shape darkness like clay.": "一些弗莫里亚人在被放逐到幽暗世界之前，一直在寻找他们的奥术荣耀。他们与黑暗实体缔结魔法契约--也许是强大的阴暗宫廷费伊人，也许是深埋于幽暗城的长生实体。契约赋予了这些弗莫里亚人控制阴影的力量，让他们可以像泥土一样塑造黑暗。",
	"Descended from Annam's son Karontor, fomorians once occupied a place in the giants' ordning between hill and stone giants. In ancient times, they were scholars of magic known for their keen intellect—but also for their inflated egos and sense of entitlement. Karontor exploited these qualities, tempting them with promises of higher standing in the ordning, and incited his descendants to launch an assault on the Feywild. When the assault failed, the fomorians were banished to the Underdark and their god was consigned to a subterranean prison. Subjected to the strange magic of the Underdark, the fomorians' bodies and souls twisted until they became the fomorians of today.": "弗莫瑞亚人是安南之子卡隆托尔的后裔，曾在巨人中的地位介于山丘巨人和石巨人之间。在古代，他们是以敏锐的智慧著称的魔法学者，但同时也是自大狂和自以为是的人。卡隆托尔利用了他们的这些特质，许诺给他们更高的地位，并煽动他的后代向费奥德发起进攻。进攻失败后，弗莫瑞人被放逐到暗黑世界，他们的神也被关进了地下监狱。在暗黑世界奇异魔法的作用下，弗莫瑞亚人的身体和灵魂发生了扭曲，直到他们变成了今天的弗莫瑞亚人。",
	"Frost giants who master rune magic are known as ice shapers, and their sheer power typically contributes to a meteoric rise in the giants' ordning. Many of them end up as jarls, leading their communities, or as advisers to jarls—often the true power behind the throne. They are usually devoted to Thrym.": "掌握符文魔法的冰霜巨人被称为 \"冰雪塑造者\"（ice shaper），他们的强大力量通常会让巨人的地位如日中天。他们中的许多人最终会成为首领，领导他们的族群，或者成为首领的顾问--他们往往是王座背后的真正力量。他们通常对特瑞姆忠心耿耿。",
	"True to their name, these ice shapers manipulate the raw elemental energy of air and water to wield ice in both offense and defense. They summon ice elementals in the shape of wolves, cloak themselves in icy armor, and just as quickly turn that armor into a hail of deadly ice shards.": "正如他们的名字一样，这些冰雪塑造者操纵空气和水的原始元素能量，在进攻和防御中挥舞冰雪。他们会召唤狼形的冰元素，为自己披上冰甲，并迅速将冰甲变成致命的冰雹。",
	"I learned enough about the Temple of Elemental Evil in my studies with Mordenkainen that I regard giants connected to the cult with a healthy amount of respect. When you combine a cultist's fanatical devotion with a giant's sheer power, the result can be horrifying.": "在和莫丹凯宁的学习中，我对元素邪恶神殿有了足够的了解，因此我对与邪教有关的巨人抱有一种健康的敬意。当你把邪教徒的狂热和巨人的力量结合在一起时，结果可能会很可怕。",
	"Though primordials of frost and ice do exist (most notably Cryonax, who is sometimes considered almost the equal of the four Princes of Elemental Evil), frost giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning to embrace Elemental Evil are more likely to serve Olhydra, the Princess of Evil Water. To these giants, water is a cruel and destructive force that finds its ultimate expression in ice. These cultists of Evil Water often hide their allegiance as long as possible while urging their communities to everincreasing depths of cruelty and violence, but if the cultists' apostasy is revealed and they are exiled, they often end up as leaders of Olhydra's cults in colder regions.": "虽然冰霜和寒冰的始祖确实存在（最著名的是克瑞奥纳克斯，他有时被认为几乎与四位邪恶元素王子平起平坐），但从奥德宁之神转而拥护邪恶元素的冰霜巨人更有可能侍奉邪恶之水公主奥利赫德拉。对这些巨人来说，水是一种残酷的毁灭性力量，它在冰中得到了最终的体现。这些邪水崇拜者通常会尽可能长时间地隐藏他们的忠诚，同时煽动他们的族群变得越来越残忍和暴力，但如果这些崇拜者的叛教行为被揭露并被流放，他们通常会在寒冷的地区成为奥利希拉邪教的领袖。",
	"Olhydra grants these frost giants the ability to breathe underwater, and they wield armor and weapons that reflect their commitment to the cult. Their armor is outfitted with enormous crossbows that can launch barbed harpoons, which the giants use to drag enemies into or through the water.": "奥利赫德拉赋予了这些冰霜巨人在水下呼吸的能力，他们所使用的盔甲和武器也反映了他们对邪教的虔诚。他们的盔甲上装有巨大的弩，可以发射带倒刺的鱼叉，巨人用鱼叉将敌人拖入水中或在水中穿行。",
	"When a frost giant is murdered in a dishonorable manner—perhaps poisoned, stabbed in the back, or killed while sleeping—the slain giant can rise as a frostmourn. Driven by its desire for vengeance, the frostmourn can turn the living into frozen statues with a touch or blast enemies with frigid wind. Achieving vengeance is not always enough to grant these creatures rest; often, their hatred and loathing of the living is sufficient to keep them roaming the wilds for years after their murderers are slain.": "当冰霜巨人以不光彩的方式被杀害时--也许是被毒死，也许是被刺中背部，也许是在睡觉时被杀死--被杀害的巨人就会变成冰霜哀伤。在复仇欲望的驱使下，霜之哀伤可以用触摸将活人变成冰冻雕像，或用寒风吹向敌人。复仇并不总能让这些生物安息；通常，它们对活人的仇恨和厌恶足以让它们在凶手被杀后的数年里一直在荒野中游荡。",
	"A frostmourn looks like a desiccated corpse mummified by exposure to bitter cold. It carries the marks of its death on its body: a wound that seeps frosty vapor or vibrant, purple veins showing the ravages of poison. It can momentarily dissolve its body into a swirling blizzard to avoid harm, reforming at a distance to continue its assault.": "霜之哀伤看起来就像一具暴露在严寒中的干尸。它的身体上有死亡的痕迹：伤口处渗出冰冻的水汽，或者是鲜艳的紫色血管，显示出毒药的肆虐。它可以瞬间将身体化为漩涡状的暴风雪，以避免受到伤害，然后在远处重新化为暴风雪继续攻击。",
	"Frost giants who struggle to rise in their ordning, along with those who reject Annam and his children, sometimes turn to the worship of the demon lord Kostchtchie. In the myths of these giants, Kostchtchie was once a frost giant of such tremendous might that he slew a demon lord in single combat, claimed its Abyssal realm for himself, and now waits for other frost giants to join him in conquering the rest of the Abyss.": "努力提升自己地位的冰霜巨人，以及那些拒绝安南和他的孩子们的冰霜巨人，有时会转而崇拜恶魔领主科斯特奇。在这些巨人的神话中，科斯特奇曾经是一个强大的冰霜巨人，他在一次战斗中杀死了恶魔领主，将其深渊领域据为己有，现在正等待其他冰霜巨人和他一起征服深渊的其他地方。",
	"When Kostchtchie answers the pleas of giants, he gives them supernatural strength and ferocious bloodlust. The giants' muscles expand, their arms extend past their knees, and bitter cold surrounds them. The demon lord's gifts come at a cost, though, as the giants' souls slowly burn away to fuel these newfound powers. Over time, the sensation of burning in the chest intensifies, driving these giants into a frenzy. The newly transformed Fiends quickly find that only combat can numb the burning.": "当科斯特奇回应巨人的请求时，他赋予他们超自然的力量和凶猛的嗜血。巨人的肌肉膨胀，手臂伸过膝盖，严寒包围着他们。不过，恶魔领主的恩赐也是有代价的，巨人的灵魂会慢慢燃烧殆尽，为这些新发现的力量提供燃料。随着时间的推移，胸口的灼烧感越来越强烈，让这些巨人陷入疯狂。新变身的恶魔很快就发现，只有战斗才能麻痹灼烧感。",
	"From time to time—perhaps once a generation, under a particular configuration of stars and planets, or at the whim of some malicious god—a gargantua is born to giant parents. Though the child appears like any other of its kind, the creature's true nature manifests upon reaching adulthood: its complexion turns purplish and horns sprout from its head. The gargantua grows rapidly, eventually towering over other giants at a height of 12 metre or more.": "时不时地--也许是一代人一次，也许是在特定的恒星和行星配置下，也许是在某个恶意的神的旨意下--巨人的父母会生下一个巨人。虽然孩子看起来与其他同类无异，但在成年后，它的本性就显现出来了：肤色变成了紫色，头上长出了角。巨巨人生长迅速，最终比其他巨人高出 12 米或更多。",
	"Most gargantuas do not feel at home in giant communities and end up searching for homes large enough to hold their enormous frames. They might find a suitable home in an ancient forest, a deep canyon, or an immense cavern in the Underdark. Some gargantuas seek only peace and solitude, while others lash out fiercely at a world that fears them.": "大多数巨型巨人都不喜欢在巨人群落中生活，最终只能寻找足以容纳它们巨大身躯的家园。它们可能会在古老的森林、幽深的峡谷或暗黑世界中巨大的洞穴中找到合适的家园。有些巨人只追求和平与孤独，而有些巨人则对这个令他们恐惧的世界发出猛烈的攻击。",
	"Giants tell a variety of stories to explain the existence of gargantuas. One tale connects their origin to an ancient enclave's pact with an entity from the Far Realm. Another claims that Karontor, \"the banished son\" of Annam, creates gargantuas in retaliation for his imprisonment. A third blames Annam, claiming the All-Father of the giants is disgusted with his descendants and seeks to destroy them.": "巨人有各种各样的故事来解释巨型巨人的存在。其中一个故事将它们的起源与一块古老飞地与远界实体的契约联系在一起。另一个故事称，安南 \"被放逐的儿子 \"卡隆托尔为了报复自己被囚禁，制造了巨巨人。第三种说法则归咎于安南，声称巨人之父对自己的后代感到厌恶，想要毁灭他们。",
	"Giants keep geese as livestock for eggs and because geese make excellent sentries, protecting the giants' property with their keen senses and loud voices. Not only are giant geese from fey stock significantly larger than ordinary geese, but they also have two magical properties that make them even more valuable: their honk is a powerful defense against intruders, and they can lay eggs with shells of pure gold.": "巨人饲养大雁，一是为了下蛋，二是因为大雁是很好的哨兵，能用敏锐的感官和响亮的嗓音保护巨人的财产。巨鹅不仅体型比普通鹅大很多，而且还具有两种神奇的特性，使它们变得更加珍贵：巨鹅的鸣叫声能有效抵御入侵者，而且它们下的蛋壳是纯金的。",
	"When commanded by its keeper, a giant goose lays a golden egg—a hollow shell of gold, 0.3 metre long and weighing 1 kilogramm. The shell is worth 100 gp. Sometimes, the egg inexplicably contains some kind of small trinket or minor magic item. Once it lays a golden egg, a giant goose can't do so again for a year and a day.": "只要饲养员一声令下，巨鹅就会下金蛋--一个 0.3 米长、1 公斤重的空心金壳。蛋壳价值 100 便士。有时，蛋中会莫名其妙地包含一些小饰品或小魔法物品。大雁一旦下了金蛋，一年零一天内就不能再下金蛋了。",

	"Though they're often mistaken for mundane cats, giant lynxes are magical creatures with origins in the snowy woodlands of the Feywild. Their coats grow lighter in winter, helping to camouflage them in their favored habitats even when the landscape is draped in snow.": "虽然巨猞猁经常被误认为是普通的猫，但它们却是起源于费尔德雪原的神奇动物。它们的皮毛在冬天会变轻，即使在白雪皑皑的地方也能伪装成它们喜欢的样子。",
	"Giant lynxes are crafty hunters, cooperating in small groups to trap prey and occasionally using a magical gift to scout likely hunting locations. They're also smart enough to outwit many of the hunters who seek to trap them for their fur, and they're fond of disabling any trappers' snares they find in their territories.": "大猞猁是狡猾的猎手，它们以小群合作的方式捕捉猎物，偶尔还会利用神奇的天赋侦察可能的狩猎地点。它们也很聪明，能智取许多想捕获它们皮毛的猎人，而且它们很喜欢破坏在领地内发现的捕猎者的陷阱。",
	"Frost and cloud giants sometimes befriend giant lynxes and treat them as beloved pets. As long as the lynxes' intelligence and independence are respected, the creatures are happy to share their divination magic with their giant companions.": "霜巨人和云巨人有时会与巨猞猁交好，并把它们当作心爱的宠物。只要猞猁的智慧和独立性得到尊重，它们就很乐意与巨人同伴分享自己的占卜魔法。",
	"Shortly before encountering the frost giant whose well-placed boulder ended my human existence, Mordenkainen and I saw a giant lynx. It was just staring into space, in that oh-so-feline way. Mordenkainen wanted to talk to it, to find out what it was looking at, but I successfully dissuaded him.": "在遇到冰霜巨人前不久，我和莫登凯宁看到了一只巨大的猞猁，它的巨石恰到好处地结束了我的生命。它只是呆呆地望着远方，就像猫科动物一样。摩登凯宁想和它说话，看看它在看什么，但我成功地劝阻了他。",

	"Giant rams are prized livestock among giants. The rams' fleece stores magical energy by absorbing ambient magic and drawing power from spells. While a ram is alive and unshorn, it uses its fleece's magic for self-defense, channeling the power it absorbs into a magical blast to drive off predators.": "巨型公羊是巨人中珍贵的牲畜。公羊的绒毛通过吸收周围的魔法和汲取咒语的力量来储存魔法能量。当公羊活着且没有被剪毛时，它可以利用绒毛中的魔力进行自卫，将吸收的魔力转化为魔法爆炸来驱赶掠食者。",
	"If the fleece is shorn from the ram without damaging the creature, it can be made into a protective magical garment. When woven into cloth, the fleece serves as a cloak of protection. It can also be woven into the lining of armor to make armor of resistance that protects against cold, fire, or lightning damage.": "如果能在不伤害生物的情况下将羊毛从公羊身上剥下，就能将其制成一件魔法防护服。将羊毛织成布后，它就成了一件保护斗篷。它还可以编织成盔甲的内衬，制成抵御寒冷、火焰或雷电伤害的盔甲。",

	"A gigant's wings are usually folded under its carapace, but the speedy flier can also beat its wings to create a horrible sound or to spread a toxic dust.": "巨蜥的翅膀通常折叠在甲壳下面，但这种飞行速度极快的动物也能拍打翅膀，发出可怕的声音或散播有毒的尘埃。",
	"Goliaths are Humanoids distantly related to giants. Infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors' mountainous home, goliaths have the strength and fortitude to garner a giant's respect. Communities of goliaths who live in close relationship with giants emulate them and are recognized by the giants as kin. These goliath giant-kin often act as liaisons between giant clans and other Humanoids.": "巨人是与巨人有远亲关系的类人猿。巨人的祖先在山中居住，他们的祖先拥有超自然的精气神，巨人的力量和毅力足以赢得巨人的尊重。与巨人生活在一起的巨人族群会模仿巨人，并被巨人视为亲属。这些巨人亲属经常充当巨人部族和其他类人生物之间的联络人。",
	"Though they rarely stand more than 2.4 metre tall, goliaths can hold their own in contests of strength with ogres. Goliath giant-kin can also channel the magic of their giant relatives into mighty melee attacks.": "虽然巨人的身高很少超过 2.4 米，但他们在与食人魔的力量较量中也不落下风。巨人族还能将其巨人亲戚的魔法转化为强大的近战攻击。",
	"Though they are not part of the ordning, goliath giant-kin often revere the divine ancestors of the giants, with a particular affinity for Annam's daughters: Diancastra, Hiatea, and Iallanis. They also tend to extol the same virtues as the giants they live alongside, so goliath giant-kin dwelling near frost giants boast of their might, while those dwelling with stone giants cherish artistry.": "虽然他们不属于ordning，但巨人巨人之亲通常崇敬巨人的神圣祖先，尤其亲近安南的女儿们： 他们特别亲近安南的女儿：黛安卡斯特拉（Diancastra）、希亚塔（Hiatea）和伊兰尼斯（Iallanis）。他们也倾向于颂扬与他们生活在一起的巨人的美德，因此住在冰霜巨人附近的巨人巨人会夸耀自己的力量，而住在石巨人附近的巨人巨人则会珍视艺术。",
	"Few things bring me as much delight as goliaths who strive to celebrate their connection to the magnificent history of giants. When they sing me hymns, their voices are sweetest.": "很少有什么事情能像巨人一样让我高兴，他们努力庆祝自己与巨人的壮丽历史的联系。当他们为我唱赞美诗时，他们的声音是最甜美的。",
	"Grinning cats are mischievous Fey who delight in pestering and misleading travelers. They resemble oversized domestic cats with long, needlelike claws, but they're distinguished by the wide, toothy smiles that give them their name.": "笑猫是一种调皮的费伊人，喜欢纠缠和误导旅行者。它们很像体型超大的家猫，长着针状的爪子，但它们的特点是呲牙咧嘴的大笑，这也是它们名字的由来。",
	"Grinning cats often dwell in or near giants' enclaves. They spend much of their time invisible, lounging on tree branches until prey—or a potential conversation partner—wanders by. While trading riddles or witticisms, a cat often decides to reveal its grin, its tail, or sometimes its whole head to confuse or intimidate the creature it's talking to.": "嬉笑猫经常住在巨人的领地里或附近。它们大部分时间都隐身在树枝上，直到猎物--或者潜在的对话伙伴--悄悄走过。在交换谜语或俏皮话时，笑脸猫经常决定露出笑脸、尾巴，有时甚至露出整个脑袋，以迷惑或恐吓交谈对象。",
	"A grinning cat can be persuaded to bestow one of its whiskers as a gift. A creature holding a whisker can use it to cast the misty step spell once, then the whisker turns to smoke and is destroyed. If a grinning cat is slain, (%0%) of its whiskers can be retrieved for this purpose.": "可以说服一只龇牙咧嘴的猫，将它的一根胡须作为礼物赠送给它。持有胡须的生物可以使用胡须施放一次缥缈步法，然后胡须会变成烟雾并销毁。如果嬉笑猫被杀死，它的（%0%）胡须可以为此目的被取回。",
	"My one and only interaction with a grinning cat made me want to wipe the smirk off that thing's face with a great big clenched fist, if you get my meaning.": "我与一只咧嘴笑的猫的唯一一次互动，让我想用紧握的拳头把它脸上的笑意擦掉，如果你明白我的意思的话。",
	"Trust me when I tell you that the cat was every bit as annoyed as you were, my friend.": "朋友，相信我，那只猫和你一样恼火。",

	"These hill giants drape themselves in rocks attached to chains or ropes, then use their magic to knock down and pummel their foes with these stones. This magic, combined with their ability to defeat and devour their prey as quickly as a torrent of boulders cascades down a mountain, leads other giants to call them avalanchers.": "这些山丘巨人用铁链或绳索拴住石头，然后用魔法将敌人击倒并用石头猛击。这种魔法再加上它们能像巨石洪流一样迅速击倒并吞噬猎物，因此其他巨人称它们为雪崩者。",
	"At least the lightning hulk and the dust hulk seem satisfied with their lot in life. There's a grace to their existence, as fractured as it seems.": "至少闪电绿巨人和尘土绿巨人似乎对自己的命运很满意。他们的存在虽然看似支离破碎，却也不失优雅。",
	"Lightning hulks are the descendants of storm giants who retreated from the world in ages past. Over the course of centuries, the elemental nature of these giants—aided by infusions of energy from the Elemental Planes—grew to dominate these giants, eventually freeing them from the limitations of flesh.": "闪电绿巨人是风暴巨人的后代，他们在过去的岁月里从这个世界上消失了。经过几个世纪的发展，这些巨人的元素本质在元素界能量注入的帮助下逐渐占据主导地位，最终摆脱了肉体的限制。",
	"A lightning hulk is essentially a living bolt of lightning, with the one lasting vestige of its former nature being a vague face that appears at the head of the bolt as it streams through the air. In rare moments, the hulk coalesces into a bipedal shape resembling a storm giant, but these moments are as fleeting as a lightning strike. At other times, particularly when near metal or solid earth, the hulk seems on the verge of dispersing entirely, losing its last shreds of cohesion as a single entity. Its mental state is similarly incoherent: a lightning hulk rushes from one place to another with little sense of purpose and no hint of the contemplation that occupies its distant cousin giants.": "闪电绿巨人本质上是一个活生生的闪电，它的前身是一个模糊的面孔，当闪电在空中划过时，这个面孔就会出现在闪电的头部。在极少数情况下，绿巨人会凝聚成类似暴风巨人的双足形状，但这些时刻就像闪电击中一样转瞬即逝。在其他时候，尤其是靠近金属或坚实的大地时，绿巨人似乎濒临完全消散的边缘，失去了作为一个整体的最后一丝凝聚力。它的精神状态也同样不连贯：闪电绿巨人从一个地方冲到另一个地方，几乎没有目标感，也没有远亲巨人的沉思。",
	"Hill giants are known for their voracious appetites, which can attract the attention of the demon lord Yeenoghu, known as the Beast of Butchery. A cruel hill giant sometimes turns to Yeenoghu for help in expanding the reach of its malevolence. Occasionally a hill giant consumes an evil artifact that transforms the giant into a fiendish form. Once in a while, Yeenoghu whispers promises of power in the dreams of a giant whose hunger surpasses other giants'. In any case, the result is a ravenous monster called a maw of Yeenoghu, which is wholly devoted to the demon lord.": "山丘巨人以贪婪的食欲著称，这可能会吸引恶魔领主耶诺古（Yeenoghu）的注意，后者被称为 \"屠兽\"。残忍的山丘巨人有时会向耶诺古求助，以扩大自己的邪恶范围。偶尔，山丘巨人会吃下一件邪恶的神器，从而变成恶魔的模样。偶尔，耶诺古会在一个巨人的梦中低声许诺给他力量，而这个巨人的饥饿感超过了其他巨人。无论如何，结果都会产生一种名为 \"耶诺古之口 \"的贪婪怪物，它对恶魔领主忠心耿耿。",
	"A maw of Yeenoghu grows a mane of hair and hunches over like a gnoll. Its jaw grows and widens, and its mouth fills with multiple rows of sharp teeth. These teeth constantly grow, driving the maw to bite and chew on anything within reach. Some maws desperately rip the teeth from their mouth for relief, but the teeth quickly regrow. Cunning maws use this phenomenon as a ready supply of weaponry, throwing clusters of teeth at their foes.": "耶诺古的大嘴长出鬃毛，像地精一样蜷缩着。它的下巴不断变大变宽，嘴里长满了多排锋利的牙齿。这些牙齿不断生长，驱使它咬嚼任何触手可及的东西。有些巨口怪拼命撕扯嘴里的牙齿以求解脱，但牙齿很快就会重新长出来。狡猾的巨口怪会利用这种现象作为武器，向敌人扔出成群的牙齿。",
	"A maw of Yeenoghu charges at its prey on all fours with its mouth wide open, scraping the ground like a plow.": "耶诺古的大嘴张开，像犁一样刮着地面，四肢着地冲向猎物。",
	"I mourn for the hulks, all of them. The sight of a mist hulk, in particular, fills me with a melancholy that is hard to shake off.": "我为所有的绿巨人哀悼。尤其是看到迷雾中的废船，我心中就充满了难以摆脱的忧郁。",
	"Descended from ancient cloud giants, mist hulks are Elementals that embody their ancestors' mixed elemental nature of Air and Water. After countless ages of isolation—often on one of the Elemental Planes or some hidden demiplane—they retain the barest hint of their ancestors' physical form, and even less of the giants' culture.": "迷雾绿巨人是远古云巨人的后裔，是体现了其祖先空气和水混合元素特性的元素生物。在经历了无数个与世隔绝的岁月后--通常是在某个元素星球或某个隐秘的半位面上--他们只保留了祖先的一丝体形，甚至连巨人的文化都没有保留。",
	"A mist hulk resembles a bipedal figure made of dark rain clouds. Parts of its body seem more solid than others, but these parts are transparent enough that the churning vapors of the hulk's substance are visible inside. Wisps of cloud constantly leak from the creature, as if it might dissolve completely at any time. When it is slain, its misty form condenses into a torrent of water.": "迷雾绿巨人就像一个由乌云组成的双足人形。它身体的一部分看起来比其他部分更坚固，但这些部分足够透明，可以看到绿巨人体内翻腾的蒸汽。一缕缕云雾不断从它身上渗出，仿佛它随时都可能完全溶解。当它被杀死时，其缥缈的形态会凝结成一股水流。",
	"A mist hulk's mood is always gloomy, and when threatened, it often howls in infectious misery. All who hear this wail are magically reminded of past regrets, real or imagined.": "迷雾绿巨人的情绪总是阴沉沉的，当受到威胁时，它往往会发出极具感染力的悲惨嚎叫。所有听到这种哀嚎的人都会神奇地想起过去的遗憾，无论是真实的还是想象的。",
	"The ancestors of mud hulks were hill giants who, living in isolation, ate everything within reach until they were forced to subsist on the earth itself. The giants' elemental nature asserted itself and transformed them into creatures of living mud.": "泥巨人的祖先是山丘巨人，他们过着与世隔绝的生活，吃掉了一切触手可及的东西，直到被迫以大地为生。巨人的元素本性使他们变成了活生生的泥浆生物。",
	"A mud hulk vaguely resembles its ancestors, but its body consists of wet mud that constantly sloughs off around it, creating thick pools of the stuff everywhere the creature goes. It retains the hunger of a hill giant, enveloping anything even vaguely edible and directly absorbing it into its body. When threatened, it hurls masses of mud at its enemies to make sure they stay in place long enough for the mud hulk to consume them.": "泥浆大块头与它的祖先依稀相似，但它的身体由湿泥组成，周围的泥浆不断脱落，所到之处都会形成厚厚的泥浆池。它保持着山丘巨人的饥饿感，会将任何可食用的东西包裹起来，并直接吸收到体内。当受到威胁时，它会向敌人投掷大量泥浆，以确保他们在原地停留足够长的时间，让泥浆大块头吞噬他们。",
	"Well, while you're mourning, that thing is trying to engulf me in mud! Pardon me while I interpose a hand to keep it away from me.": "你在哀悼的时候，那东西正试图用泥巴把我吞没！请原谅我插上一只手，让它离我远点。",

	"Rime hulks are a withered branch of the frost giant family tree, descended from ancient giants who withdrew from the world and succumbed to their elemental nature. Most rime hulks dwell in the Frostfell, the \"plane of ice\" that forms the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. Others lurk in isolated rifts in enormous polar glaciers.": "石灰绿巨人是冰霜巨人家族树上的一个枯萎的分支，是远古巨人的后裔，他们远离世界，屈服于自己的元素本性。大多数石灰绿巨人居住在冰霜原野（Frostfell），这个 \"冰原 \"是空气元素界和水元素界的分界线。还有一些则潜伏在巨大的极地冰川中孤立的裂缝中。",
	"Smaller and weaker than their ancestors, rime hulks are roughly formed masses of frost and ice. Their vaguely giant-shaped physical forms are unstable, constantly breaking apart and reforming as clouds of frost billow off them. As a rime hulk moves, it leaves a trail of ice that can freeze enemies in place. When it dies, a rime hulk explodes in a burst of frost.": "与它们的祖先相比，\"冰霜大块头 \"体积更小，力量更弱，它们是由冰霜和冰块组成的粗糙块体。它们隐约的巨型体态并不稳定，会不断碎裂，并随着冰霜云的飘散而重组。当冰冻绿巨人移动时，它会留下一道冰痕，可以将敌人冻结在原地。当它死亡时，冰泥绿巨人会在一阵冰霜中爆炸。",
	"In all seriousness, though, it's best not to get caught up in what these hulks were or might have become had things gone differently for them. They're dangerous, and most of them do not wish you well. Act accordingly.": "不过，说实在的，最好不要沉迷于这些大块头曾经是什么样子，或者如果事情发生了变化，他们可能会变成什么样子。他们很危险，而且他们中的大多数人都不希望你过得好。行动起来吧。",
	"According to(%0%), told by giants on some worlds, a disparate group of giants combined their efforts to protect their ancient empire from a particularly vicious dragon. Stone and hill giants hewed a mighty form from living stone. Cloud and frost giants gathered rare metals, and fire giants shaped them into flexible joints and plated armor. Storm giants inscribed runes into the inert form to give it the semblance of life. The fruit of these labors was an everlasting guardian: the first runic colossus.": "据（%0%）一些世界的巨人讲述，一群不相干的巨人为了保护他们的古老帝国免受一条特别凶恶的巨龙的侵袭而联合起来。石巨人和山丘巨人用活生生的石头凿出了一个强大的造型。云巨人和冰霜巨人收集稀有金属，火巨人将它们塑造成灵活的关节和镀金盔甲。风暴巨人将符文刻入惰性形态，赋予其生命的雏形。这些劳动的成果就是一个永恒的守护者：第一个符文巨像。",
	"A runic colossus stands 9 metre tall. It regards all non-giants as a threat, and unless it has other orders, it attacks such creatures on sight.": "符文巨像高达 9 米。它视所有非巨人为威胁，除非另有命令，否则它一见到这些生物就会发动攻击。",
	"The art of crafting a runic colossus is lost to modern giants, but many tales suggest the instructions might be buried deep in ruins from ancient giants' empires.": "现代巨人已经失传了制作符文巨像的技艺，但许多传说表明，这些说明可能深埋在古代巨人帝国的废墟中。",

	"Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See \" Giants of Myth \" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)": "巨人是万物之父安南及其子孙的后裔。但巨人之神的子孙有更大的权利：他们是安南的孙子，在巨人中享有特权。在某些世界，这些后裔统治着最初的巨人帝国，直到安南隐居。在其他世界，子孙们守护着他们的出生地（那里蕴藏着丰富的元素魔法），或者维系着世界的物质。(更多灵感请参见第 3 章 \"神话中的巨人\"）。",
	"Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.": "巨人之神的后裔是非常强大的生物，他们为周围的世界注入了原始的魔力。在许多世界中，他们沉睡着，成为了风景的一部分。在这种情况下，每个巨神之子都被封印在一个名为 \"摇篮 \"的强大元素体内。摇篮会保护沉睡的子孙，并遵循其潜意识的意愿，包括驱赶入侵者。但如果摇篮死亡，里面的子孙就会完全苏醒。",
	"A cloud giant that dies through an act of betrayal or an ill-fated wager sometimes returns as a spectral cloud. While this Undead seems to be merely a thick cloud or fog bank, observers can sometimes spot a shadowy bipedal figure lurking within. At the heart of the cloud, the figure's appearance becomes clear: a skeletal cloud giant corpse.": "因背叛行为或命运不济的赌注而死亡的云巨人有时会化身为幽灵云返回。虽然这种亡灵看起来只是厚厚的云层或雾气，但观察者有时会发现其中潜藏着一个朦胧的双足人影。到了云的中心，这个身影的样子就会变得清晰起来：一具骷髅云巨人的尸体。",
	"Tales suggest cloud giants sometimes seek this fate rather than accept the end of their naturally long lives. In such stories, a cloud giant undergoes a ritual in which its heart is transplanted into a cloud, causing the giant's body to dissolve and its spirit to animate the cloud.": "传说中，云巨人有时会寻求这种命运，而不是接受其自然漫长生命的终结。在这些故事中，云巨人要经历一个仪式，将自己的心脏移植到云中，这样巨人的身体就会溶解，而它的灵魂则会赋予云以生命。",
	"When it comes to infiltrating giant steadings, I must admit that spotted lions are in some ways preferable to, say, dire wolves or cave bears. Namely, if they're well fed, they're more likely to stretch and yawn than they are to raise an alarm when they spot you.": "说到潜入巨型营地，我必须承认，斑狮在某些方面比地狼或穴熊更受欢迎。也就是说，如果它们吃饱了，在发现你时，它们更有可能伸伸懒腰、打打哈欠，而不是发出警报。",
	"Roughly twice the size of a common lion, a spotted lion has a dusky coat and mane, both speckled with charcoal-colored spots. Spotted lions gather in prides to hunt enormous prey ranging from giant elk to mammoths.

	"Demon worship is rare among stone giants; the destructive tendency of demons is the antithesis of the artistry that drives the stone giant's ordning. The Horned King, Baphomet, is an exception. Though he is a merciless hunter, the Prince of Beasts also crafts complex mazes as his hunting grounds. Stone giants can become mesmerized by the demon lord's mazes and enter his service. These giants can continue pursuing art by crafting mazes, while satiating their bloodlust by hunting in them.": "石巨人很少崇拜恶魔；恶魔的破坏倾向与石巨人的艺术性是对立的。角王巴弗灭是个例外。虽然他是无情的猎手，但这位野兽王子也会精心设计复杂的迷宫作为他的狩猎场。石巨人会被恶魔领主的迷宫迷住，并加入他的麾下。这些巨人可以通过制作迷宫继续追求艺术，同时通过在迷宫中狩猎满足他们的嗜血欲望。",

	"Stone giants practice rune magic more than other giants do, perhaps because of these giants' interest in and aptitude for carving stone. Stone giants who combine this magic with prodigious artistic skill are called rockspeakers. Within their communities, they act as leaders and oracles.": "石巨人比其他巨人更多地使用符文魔法，这也许是因为这些巨人对雕刻石头很感兴趣，而且擅长雕刻石头。将符文魔法与高超的艺术技巧结合在一起的石巨人被称为 \"石语者\"（rockpeakers）。在他们的族群中，他们扮演着领袖和神谕者的角色。",
	"Rockspeakers incorporate crystals and stones into their clothing and embed them in their skin.

	"Giants on some worlds claim Stronmaus or one of his children created storm crabs in the early years of an ancient empire. Just as behirs were created to fight dragons on land and rocs to challenge dragons' mastery of the sky, storm crabs were meant to battle dragon turtles, bronze dragons, and other aquatic foes. On many worlds, these creatures fiercely guard the underwater strongholds of storm giants, as well as the ruined keeps giants have abandoned.": "一些世界的巨人声称，斯特朗默斯或他的一个孩子在古代帝国的早期创造了暴风蟹。暴风蟹的诞生是为了在陆地上与龙作战，而大鹏则是为了挑战龙对天空的掌控，同样，暴风蟹也是为了与龙龟、青铜龙和其他水生敌人作战。在许多世界中，这些生物凶猛地守卫着风暴巨人的水下据点，以及被巨人遗弃的废墟。",

	"While most storm giants care little for the intricate details of ranking in the ordning, tempest callers proudly claim a position at the pinnacle of that ranking—and few dare to challenge them. Wielding the power of rune magic in addition to the innate magic that courses through them, these storm giants are highly respected. If any giant can draw Annam's attention to the world, it would likely be a tempest caller.": "大多数暴风巨人都不在意军阶排名的复杂细节，而暴风召唤者却自豪地宣称自己处于军阶的顶峰--很少有人敢向他们挑战。除了与生俱来的魔法之外，这些风暴巨人还拥有符文魔法的力量，因此备受尊敬。如果说有哪个巨人能吸引安南的注意，那很可能就是暴风召唤者。",

They can also create a momentary vortex of freezing winds and storm clouds around themselves, engulfing their foes in elemental fury.": "暴风召唤者将刻有风暴符文的水晶球植入额头或眼窝，使他们能够看穿魔法欺骗。他们还能在自己周围瞬间形成冰冻风和风暴云的漩涡，用元素之怒吞噬敌人。",
	"Ancient and alien beings dwell or slumber in ocean depths, awaiting some cosmic circumstance that signals their time to rise. In their retreat from the world, storm giants sometimes stray into the orbit of such creatures, perhaps while seeking insight into some omen, vision, or prophecy.

	"A storm giant can escape death through a mystical ritual that transforms the giant into a semiconscious storm. However, if the giant performs the ritual in a place where the barrier between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is thin, the seeping negative energy drastically alters the ritual's outcome. The giant's soul becomes infused with negative energy and doesn't disperse into the elements. Rather, it absorbs the elemental energy around it, and its lower body becomes a storm cloud. The resulting tempest spirit is similar in appearance to a djinni and is sometimes mistaken for one by adventurers.": "风暴巨人可以通过神秘的仪式逃脱死亡，仪式会将巨人转化为半昏迷的风暴。但是，如果巨人在物质界和暗影界之间的屏障很薄的地方举行仪式，渗入的负能量就会大大改变仪式的结果。巨人的灵魂会被负能量灌注，但不会分散到元素中。相反，它吸收了周围的元素能量，下半身变成了风暴云。由此产生的暴风之灵外形与精灵相似，有时会被冒险者误认为是精灵。",

Sometimes troll worshipers of Vaprak hear a call to gather in the Underdark and perform a gruesome rite that fuses them into an amalgam that is regarded as an avatar of their fearsome god.": "当多个巨怪在再生过程中融合在一起时，就会形成巨怪汞合金。这种情况有时发生在许多巨魔在一场战斗中被杀死、巨魔的器官被扔进炼尸坑或乱葬岗，或是邪恶施法者的扭曲仪式中。有时，瓦普拉克的巨魔崇拜者会听到召唤，聚集在幽暗之城，举行可怕的仪式，将他们融合成一个混合物，被视为他们可怕神灵的化身。",
	"A troll amalgam is a misshapen mass of rubbery flesh, claws, and faces. If a creature tries to attack it from beyond its reach or to escape through a small tunnel, the troll amalgam tears off a piece of its own body and hurls it at the creature. These body parts eventually regenerate into full trolls, and sometimes they regather and combine into a new troll amalgam.": "巨怪汞合金是一团由橡胶肉、爪子和脸组成的变形体。如果有生物试图从它触及不到的地方攻击它，或者试图通过小隧道逃跑，巨怪汞合金就会撕下自己身体的一部分，然后扔向生物。这些身体部分最终会再生为完整的巨怪，有时它们会重新聚集，组合成一个新的巨怪汞合金。",
	"When exposed to corrupting alien energy, such as that found near a gate to the Far Realm or the strange magic that emanates through the Underdark, a regenerating troll undergoes strange mutations. Among the most common mutations are wings, stretchable bodies, resistance to magic, and a strange reflective psychic property. Many troll mutates also have small additional limbs and eyes, externalized organs, and other variations.": "当接触到腐蚀性的外来能量时，比如在通往远界的大门附近发现的能量，或者在幽暗城中散发出的奇特魔法，再生巨怪就会发生奇特的变异。最常见的变异包括翅膀、可伸展的身体、对魔法的抵抗力以及奇特的反射灵力特性。许多巨怪变异体还拥有额外的小四肢和眼睛、外置器官以及其他变异。",
	"The dwarven tale titled(%0%)claims the god Vaprak the Destroyer came into being when Annam was injured and his blood spilled on the ground. The saga further claims that trolls were born similarly when Vaprak's blood was spilled. Whatever the truth of their origin, trolls embody life's steadfast determination to grow and thrive despite all obstacles.": "矮人传说（%0%）称，毁灭者瓦普拉克神是在安南受伤、鲜血洒落地面时诞生的。传奇还称，瓦普拉克的鲜血洒在地上时，巨怪也同样诞生了。无论起源的真相如何，巨怪都体现了生命不畏艰险、茁壮成长的坚定决心。",
	"Trolls' rapid healing makes them subject to bizarre mutations, particularly when they regenerate in unusual environments or heal from extraordinary magical wounds. Troll amalgams and troll mutates are two examples of such strangely mutated forms.": "巨怪的快速愈合能力使它们会发生奇异的变异，尤其是当它们在不寻常的环境中再生或从非凡的魔法创伤中愈合时。巨怪合体体和巨怪变异体就是这种奇怪变异形态的两个例子。",
	"I'll just keep reminding myself that the gods delight in the variety of their creations, new wonders are revealed every day, and the multiverse is much larger than I can imagine. And that's a good thing!": "我只能不断提醒自己，众神乐于看到他们创造的各种事物，每天都有新的奇迹出现，多元宇宙比我想象的要大得多。这是件好事！",

	"The altisaur is a titanic sauropod often likened to a walking mountain, with craggy spines, patterns of elemental energy that glow in its hide like streams of lava, and eight massive legs the size of ancient trees. It creates gullies where its tail drags along the ground. Clouds often seem to gather around its head, which can reach as high as 150 feet off the ground.": "坛龙是一种泰坦巨型类人猿，通常被比喻为一座行走的山峰，身上长满了峭壁上的刺，元素能量的图案在它的皮毛上发光，就像熔岩流一样，八条巨大的腿有古树那么粗。它的尾巴拖在地上会形成沟壑。云层似乎经常聚集在它的头部，它的头部离地可高达 150 英尺。",
	"Stretching over 200 feet from the tip of its enormous nose horn to the end of its spiky tail, a ceratops gleams with lines of vibrant green energy in its thickly scaled hide.

Incredibly tall and lanky, the scion towers 75 feet tall and wields a morningstar made from magically dense clouds.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，梅姆诺的后裔就会从消散的云层中出现，它经常大笑不止，仿佛刚刚听到了一个天大的笑话。它高大瘦削，身高 75 英尺，手持由神奇的浓云制成的晨星。",

	"If the cradle is destroyed, its icy body shatters to reveal the awakened scion of Thrym inside it. Forming a double-bladed axe in its hand, the 70-foot-tall scion rushes at any foe that dares to challenge it. Emulating sagas of Thrym, the scion can achieve a tremendous feat of strength: creating a glacier in the ground and hurling it skyward, along with any creatures standing on it.": "如果摇篮被毁，其冰冷的躯体就会碎裂，露出里面苏醒的瑟姆后裔。高 70 英尺的子孙手握双刃斧，冲向任何敢于挑战它的敌人。仿效特瑞姆的传奇故事，子孙可以发挥出巨大的力量：在地面上形成冰川，然后将冰川连同站在冰川上的任何生物一起抛向天空。",

	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Skoraeus inside it awakens. At nearly 70 feet tall, it towers over most other creatures and wields a mass of crystal as a club.

	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Stronmaus inside it awakens. Among the mightiest creatures of all giantkind, the scion stands 80 feet tall. It often finds some relief in waking and being freed from its troubling dreams, so it doesn't necessarily lash out in violence when emerging from its cradle.

	"From time to time—perhaps once a generation, under a particular configuration of stars and planets, or at the whim of some malicious god—a gargantua is born to giant parents. Though the child appears like any other of its kind, the creature's true nature manifests upon reaching adulthood: its complexion turns purplish and horns sprout from its head. The gargantua grows rapidly, eventually towering over other giants at a height of 40 feet or more.": "时不时地--也许是一代人一次，也许是在特定的恒星和行星配置下，也许是在某个恶意的神的旨意下--巨人的父母会生下一个巨人。虽然孩子看起来与其他同类无异，但在成年后，它的本性就显现出来了：肤色变成了紫色，头上长出了角。巨型巨人生长迅速，最终比其他巨人高出 40 英尺或更多。",
	"When commanded by its keeper, a giant goose lays a golden egg—a hollow shell of gold, 1 foot long and weighing 2 pounds. The shell is worth 100 gp.
