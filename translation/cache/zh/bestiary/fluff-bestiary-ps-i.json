	"The practical and sympathetic angels of Flight Alabaster were instrumental in maintaining Avacyn's wards against the supernatural evils of Innistrad. They preferred the use of spells to weapons, and engaged in battle only when they had exhausted other options. As a result, angels of other flights sometimes dismissed them as overly sentimental. Alabaster angels aided priests and cathars in maintaining the protective wards on city walls and at holy sites throughout the plane, and also aided Avacyn in conducting the spirits of the dead to their ultimate fate, dissolving into Innistrad's Æthereal essence. The leader of Flight Alabaster was (%0%), called the Light of Alabaster.": "阿拉巴斯特飞行天使务实而富有同情心，他们在维护阿瓦辛的防线，抵御因尼斯特拉德的超自然邪恶方面发挥了重要作用。比起武器，他们更喜欢使用法术，只有在用尽其他办法后才会投入战斗。因此，其他种族的天使有时会认为他们过于感情用事。阿拉巴斯特天使协助祭司和卡塔维护城墙上和整个位面圣地的防护罩，还协助阿瓦辛引导亡灵走向最终的命运，溶入因尼斯特拉德的Æthereal本质中。阿拉巴斯特飞行队的首领是 (%0%)，被称为阿拉巴斯特之光。",

	"Flight Goldnight was an army of soldier-angels focused on the martial strength of the church. These angels were characterized by pragmatism and strict observance of church law.

The angels of Flight Alabaster had always been at the forefront of the church's efforts to root out and punish demon cultists, necromancers, and other heretics. With Emrakul's approach, they grew at least as mad as (%0%) herself. Their fervent obsession drove the forces of the Lunarch Inquisition, the church's efforts to root out sin among the human populace.

	"Innistrad is filled with the ghosts of the human dead. These spirits, called geists, take many forms. Some are protective ancestors, some are simply lost between life and death, and others are vengeful creatures bent on resolving conflicts they couldn't in life. While Avacyn stood as guardian over Innistrad, she and the angels of Flight Alabaster ushered the spirits of the departed into the Æther, where they rejoined the essence of the plane. In her absence—and now her madness—many spirits cling to the world of the living, unable or unwilling to find their way to the Blessed Sleep.": "因伊斯特拉德到处都是人类亡灵的鬼魂。这些亡灵被称为地祇，有多种形式。有些是保护人类的祖先，有些只是迷失在生与死之间，还有些是复仇的生物，他们一心想解决生前无法解决的冲突。当阿瓦辛作为守护者站在因尼斯特拉德时，她和飞天阿拉巴斯特的天使们将逝者的灵魂送入以太，在那里他们与这个位面的本质重合。由于她的缺席--以及现在她的疯狂--许多亡灵依附于生者世界，无法或不愿找到通往神圣睡眠的道路。",
	"Geists exist in the space between the material and immaterial realms. Although their nature and substance are fundamentally insubstantial, allowing them to pass through walls or disappear entirely from view, they can affect the material world in a variety of ways. Some can make themselves solid for a brief time, or can solidify parts of themselves or items they hold—typically long enough to slash open a throat with a weapon or claws. Others operate at the level of the mind, instilling deadly fear within the living or twisting their senses. Victims believe so strongly in the illusory harm being inflicted on them by a geist that they actually suffer injury. Some geists can affect temperatures, using cold to numb or freeze the living—particularly when humans get lost on the moors or wander too far into bogs. Some use psychokinetic power to wrap brambles, chains, spikes, or glass around themselves, then wield those objects against the living.": "地精存在于物质世界和非物质世界之间。虽然它们的性质和物质从根本上来说都是非实体的，可以穿墙而过或完全从视线中消失，但它们能以各种方式影响物质世界。有的能在短时间内让自己变成实体，有的能凝固自己的部分身体或所持物品--通常凝固的时间足以用武器或爪子割开喉咙。另一些则在精神层面上运作，给活人灌输致命的恐惧或扭曲他们的感官。受害者对地精造成的虚幻伤害深信不疑，以至于真的受到了伤害。有些地精可以影响温度，利用寒冷使活人麻木或冻僵--尤其是当人类在荒野迷路或误入沼泽时。有些地精利用精神动力将荆棘、铁链、尖刺或玻璃缠绕在自己身上，然后挥舞这些物体对付活人。",
	"Geists have always been a presence on Innistrad. Some manifest on the plane only because of a grudge or regret powerful enough to disturb the Blessed Sleep of the body to which they were connected. Others linger because of a strong desire to protect their living kin, or because of some obsession forcing them to continue a duty they performed in life.": "地祇一直都是因尼瑞德的存在。有些地灵只是因为怨恨或悔恨而出现在这个位面，其强大的力量足以扰乱与之相连的躯体的祝福沉睡。另一些则因为强烈的保护生前亲人的愿望，或者因为某种执念迫使他们继续履行生前的职责。",
	"Most geists have the ability to take control of corporeal bodies, including those still inhabited by the living. To possess a living person, a geist must overpower its victim's will, making it much easier to inhabit a corpse or a zombie. As long as the possession lasts, the geist has complete control over a living victim, which is forced to watch its body act without any ability to stop it.": "大多数地精都有控制肉体的能力，包括那些仍由活人居住的肉体。要附身到活人身上，地精必须压制受害者的意志，因此附身到尸体或僵尸身上要容易得多。只要附身持续一段时间，地精就能完全控制活人，活人只能眼睁睁地看着自己的身体行动，却无法阻止。",
	"As creatures of pure spirit, geists are partially sustained by the mana that flows through the plane of Innistrad. Thus, each geist is closely associated with one or more colors of mana, and its nature and attitude are shaped by the characteristics of that mana. The effects of possession by a geist likewise depend on the geist:": "作为纯粹的精神生物，地精的部分生命来源于流淌在因尼瑞德星球上的法力。因此，每个地精都与一种或多种颜色的法力密切相关，其本质和态度也是由法力的特性决定的。鬼怪附身的效果同样取决于鬼怪：",

	"Black-aligned geists hate the living, hungering eternally for life, power, or the settling of a wicked grudge.

Necro-alchemists sometimes call themselves geistmages, but different practitioners identify themselves in different ways. What all have in common, however, is their use of elaborate contraptions to capture, bind, and draw the energy from geists.": "一些奇异古怪的科学家利用地师--亡灵--作为能量来源，在生物身上进行奇怪的实验，并为疯狂的技术发明提供燃料。亡灵炼金术士有时自称为 \"地师\"（geistmages），但不同的实践者有不同的自称方式。不过，他们的共同点是使用精心制作的装置来捕捉、束缚和汲取地精的能量。",
	"This technology is often employed to power sprawling laboratories. But some necro-alchemists have managed to bind geists to smaller containers, including tubelike canisters that are strapped to the back and attached to weapons that hurl lightning.

	"The history of Strefan Maurer runs parallel to that of Strahd von Zarovich. After his father's death, Strefan studied magic and forged a pact with the demon Shilgengar in return for the promise of immortality. After murdering his brother Sergei and drinking his blood, Strefan journeyed to Markov Manor and consulted with Edgar Markov. Together, they worked with Shilgengar to create the twelve bloodlines of vampires on Innistrad. Maurer Estate (Castle Ravenloft) was not spirited away to a demiplane—it was already on Innistrad, itself a place of nightmares. And Strefan is not trapped here, so he is not seeking a successor in hopes of escaping. Newcomers to his domain do attract his attention, though, as the possibility of meeting a new consort is always on Strefan's mind.": "斯特凡-毛雷尔的历史与斯特雷德-冯-扎罗维奇的历史并行不悖。父亲死后，斯特凡学习了魔法，并与恶魔希尔根格签订了契约，以换取长生不老的承诺。斯特凡杀死了他的哥哥谢尔盖并喝了他的血，然后来到马尔科夫庄园，向埃德加-马尔科夫请教。他们与希尔根格合作，在因尼斯特拉德创造了十二种吸血鬼血统。毛雷尔庄园（拉文洛夫城堡）并没有被转移到半位面，它本来就在因尼斯特拉德，而因尼斯特拉德本身就是一个噩梦之地。史提芬并没有被困在这里，所以他并没有寻找继承人以求逃脱。不过，新来到他领地的人确实会引起他的注意，因为斯特凡总是惦记着遇到新妃子的可能性。",
	"Strefan's statistics are unchanged from the statistics of (%0%) in the Curse of Strahd adventure, except that he lacks the Vampire Weaknesses feature. Instead, Strefan has the weaknesses shared by Innistrad vampires (see that earlier section).": "斯特凡的数据与《斯特拉赫德的诅咒》冒险中 (%0%) 的数据相同，只是他没有吸血鬼的弱点特性。取而代之的是，史提芬拥有 \"因尼斯特拉德 \"吸血鬼共有的弱点（参见前面的章节）。",
	"The vampires of Innistrad form a civilization that stands alongside and in direct competition with humanity, presenting the greatest danger to human life on the plane. Like werewolves, vampires were originally human, and they view themselves as successors to the weak human race—even as they grudgingly recognize that they require humans to feed upon. Vampires are the embodiment of self-indulgent desire, pursuing hedonistic cravings that humans suppress out of a sense of morality and propriety. In their stately manor houses, sprawling courts, and towering castles, four great family lines of vampires show varying degrees of aggressiveness toward their human prey.": "因尼斯特拉德的吸血鬼形成了一个与人类并存并直接竞争的文明，对这个星球上的人类生命构成了最大的威胁。和狼人一样，吸血鬼最初也是人类，他们将自己视为弱小人类的继承者--即使他们勉强承认自己需要以人类为食。吸血鬼是自我放纵欲望的化身，他们追求享乐主义的渴望，而人类却出于道德感和礼节压抑着这种渴望。在庄严的庄园、广阔的宫廷和高耸的城堡中，四大吸血鬼家族对人类猎物表现出不同程度的侵略性。",

	"Vampires have distinctive eyes, appearing as pools of gold or silver surrounded by black. Their hair is often black but can also be deep purple, dark magenta, burgundy, or even dark blue-green. Some vampires wear wigs for variety, novelty, or to disguise themselves more easily among humans. They have pale skin that is cool to the touch. Their canine teeth are slightly pronounced at all times, and they extend significantly when they bite to feed. Vampires also tend to have long and slightly curved fingernails.": "吸血鬼的眼睛与众不同，看起来就像被黑色包围的金色或银色水池。他们的头发通常是黑色的，但也可能是深紫色、深洋红色、酒红色，甚至是深蓝绿色。有些吸血鬼会戴假发，以增加多样性和新奇感，或者在人类中更容易伪装自己。他们的皮肤苍白，摸上去凉凉的。他们的犬齿在任何时候都略微突出，咬人进食时犬齿会明显伸长。吸血鬼的指甲也往往很长，略微弯曲。",
	"Many vampires learn a unique form of mind-affecting magic that enables them to move among humans undetected. Called the glamer, this power alters what nearby humans think they're perceiving, as opposed to true illusion magic that masks the subject's appearance. As such, particularly strong-willed humans can sometimes shake off the effects of the glamer to see a vampire's true form.": "许多吸血鬼学会了一种独特的影响心智的魔法，这种魔法能让他们在人类中行动而不被发现。这种能力被称为 \"眩光术\"，它能改变附近人类的感知，而不是真正的幻术，它能掩盖主体的外表。因此，意志特别坚强的人类有时可以摆脱光晕术的影响，看到吸血鬼的真面目。",
	"Weapons cut from living wood are particularly effective against vampires, though any weapon can harm or kill them. A vampire can't cross running water that shows the reflection of the moon, and water blessed by Avacyn ((%0%)) burns vampire flesh like acid. A vampire's reflection in silver (including a silver-backed glass mirror) appears as the vampire would have looked without the vampiric condition—neither its true appearance nor its glamer, but a normal human, flaws and all. For that reason, vampires go to great lengths to avoid mirrors, and the presence of silver in any form is unsettling to them.": "用活木砍成的武器对吸血鬼特别有效，但任何武器都能伤害或杀死他们。吸血鬼无法越过有月亮倒影的流水，被阿瓦辛（（%0%））祝福过的水会像酸一样灼伤吸血鬼的肉体。吸血鬼在银镜（包括银背玻璃镜）中的倒影会呈现出吸血鬼没有吸血鬼状态时的样子--既不是吸血鬼的真实面貌，也不是吸血鬼的光彩，而是一个正常的人类，瑕不掩瑜。因此，吸血鬼千方百计地躲避镜子，任何形式的银都会让他们感到不安。",
	"A vampire needs to consume the blood of living humans for sustenance. At a minimum, during any given cycle of the moon, a vampire must drink as much blood as an average adult human contains (about five liters). Without enough blood, the vampire dries and shrivels, eventually crumbling to dust. Given the opportunity, most vampires will happily consume more blood than they strictly need.": "吸血鬼需要吸食活人的血液来维持生命。在任何特定的月轮中，吸血鬼至少要喝下一个普通成年人所含的血液（约五升）。没有足够的血液，吸血鬼就会干枯、萎缩，最终化为灰烬。只要有机会，大多数吸血鬼都会乐此不疲地吸食比他们严格需要的更多的血液。",
	"Typically, a vampire drinks so much blood from a human that the victim dies, but sometimes the vampire is interrupted and the human survives and recovers. Such survivors are often met with suspicion and fear, but they never become vampires unless an actual exchange of blood has occurred—which is always a deliberate act on the vampire's part. These survivors are often plagued by unsettling (and sometimes disturbingly erotic) dreams, but they suffer no other lasting consequences.": "通常情况下，吸血鬼会大量吸食人类的血液，导致受害者死亡，但有时吸血鬼会被打断，而人类则会存活下来并恢复健康。这些幸存者通常会受到怀疑和恐惧，但他们永远不会变成吸血鬼，除非发生了真正的血液交换--这总是吸血鬼故意为之的行为。这些幸存者经常会被令人不安（有时甚至是令人不安的色情梦境）的梦境所困扰，但他们不会遭受其他持久的后果。",
	"The selfish and arrogant vampires view humans as cattle in comparison to the elegance and sophistication of vampire society. Of course, that \"sophistication\" consists mostly of treachery and debauchery, where grudges and betrayals are a source of amusement. The vampires' endless revels, feasts, romances, and intrigues are rife with decadence and hedonism. They overindulge in everything, including sex, food, drink, entertainment, sleep, and scheming.": "与吸血鬼社会的优雅和复杂相比，自私而傲慢的吸血鬼视人类为牲畜。当然，这种 \"高雅 \"主要由背叛和放荡组成，恩怨和背叛成为他们的娱乐。吸血鬼们无休止的狂欢、盛宴、浪漫和阴谋充斥着颓废和享乐主义。他们过度沉溺于一切，包括性、食物、饮料、娱乐、睡眠和阴谋诡计。",
	"Innistrad's ancient history speaks of a human alchemist and healer named Edgar Markov, who sought to preserve his own life and the lives of his family. As old age began to claim him, he despaired of finding an alchemical solution and turned to black magic. Not long after, the demon Shilgengar appeared to Markov and revealed a means by which he could achieve immortality: a dark ritual that involved drinking an angel's blood.": "在因尼斯特拉德的古老历史中，有一位名叫埃德加-马可夫的人类炼金术士和治疗师，他一直在努力保护自己和家人的生命。随着年事已高，他对找到炼金术的解决方案感到绝望，于是转而使用黑魔法。不久之后，恶魔希尔根格出现在马可夫面前，向他揭示了一种可以让他获得永生的方法：一种涉及饮用天使之血的黑暗仪式。",
	"The vampires of Innistrad are all descended from twelve ancient sires—the congregation that participated in Markov's blasphemous ritual. Of these twelve bloodlines, four constitute the vast majority of Innistrad's vampires: Markov, Voldaren, Falkenrath, and Stromkirk.": "因尼斯特拉德的吸血鬼都是十二个古老先祖的后裔，也就是参加了马尔科夫亵渎仪式的那群人。在这十二个血脉中，有四个血脉构成了 \"因尼斯特拉德 \"吸血鬼的绝大多数： 马尔科夫、伏尔达伦、法尔肯拉斯和斯特罗姆柯克。",
	"Driven by their passions, their supernatural hunger, and the cycle of the moon, werewolves shed their tenuous humanity to embrace the savage predator within. They live along the boundary between humanity and supernatural evil, between civilization and the wilds, between light and utter darkness. Gathering in wild packs or hunting alone under the silver moon, werewolves embody the urge to violence, the rebellion against social mores and the chains of conscience, and the hunting instinct that lives within the human heart.": "在激情、超自然饥饿和月亮轮回的驱使下，狼人褪去脆弱的人性，拥抱内心野蛮的掠食者。他们生活在人性与超自然邪恶、文明与荒野、光明与彻底黑暗之间。狼人或成群结队，或独自在银月下狩猎，他们体现了暴力的冲动、对社会风气和良知枷锁的反抗，以及人类内心深处的狩猎本能。",
	"Lycanthropy—the condition that turns humans into werewolves—is a supernatural curse that causes the victim's spiritual essence to become mingled with the wild essence of nature, symbolized by the wolf. The lycanthrope can be thought of as possessing two souls, or a single soul split between two essences that constantly battle for control. When the wild wolf essence triumphs, the werewolf change occurs. This might explain why werewolves hunt humans so often; the wolf essence desires to destroy the human side and triumph over humanity, and does so symbolically through brutal murder.": "狼人症--将人类变成狼人的病症--是一种超自然的诅咒，会使受害者的精神本质与大自然的野性本质（以狼为象征）混合在一起。狼人可以被认为拥有两个灵魂，或者说一个灵魂被两个本质分割，而这两个本质不断争夺控制权。当野狼的本质取得胜利时，狼人就会发生变化。这也许可以解释为什么狼人经常猎杀人类；狼的本质渴望摧毁人类的一面，战胜人类，并通过残忍的谋杀象征性地实现这一目标。",
	"A person afflicted with lycanthropy is forever in doubt of his or her own urges and instincts. In human form, a werewolf feels the pull of the wolf's essence even while fully engaged with human society. All lycanthropes feel the war of emotions in their hearts, and as the moon grows full, conscience, religion, and personal restraint wield less and less influence. The full moon makes the change inevitable, but any strong emotion or traumatic experience can also trigger the transformation.": "患上狼人症的人永远都会怀疑自己的冲动和本能。在人类形态下，狼人即使完全融入人类社会，也能感受到狼的本质的牵引。所有狼人都能感受到内心的情感战争，随着月圆之夜的到来，良知、宗教和个人克制的影响力越来越小。满月使得这种变化不可避免，但任何强烈的情感或创伤经历也会触发这种转变。",
	"Werewolves in either form seem to be able to tell a human-form lycanthrope by scent. Indeed, humans who are mysteriously spared during werewolf rampages are often suspected of being werewolves themselves.": "无论是哪种形态的狼人，似乎都能通过气味分辨出人类形态的狼人。事实上，在狼人肆虐时神秘地幸免于难的人类常常被怀疑本身就是狼人。",
	"Werewolves in canid form are beings of unparalleled savagery and strength. Their bodies are perfectly engineered for slaughter, with jaws capable of snapping bone and claws sharp enough to rip the entrails from a beast many times their size. Their minds are explosions of instinct and adrenaline, fed supernatural awareness from their heightened senses yet cognitively blind to almost everything but the kill. They can walk upright for manual dexterity or lope on four limbs for speed. Their howl is said to release the wolf's spirit within, a harrowing sound that fogs the air and chills the night. Werewolves in canid form cannot speak human languages, but seem to be able to communicate with each other on matters of hunting, dominance, and social hierarchy, as canines do in the wild.": "犬科形态的狼人拥有无与伦比的野蛮和力量。它们的身体是为屠杀而完美设计的，下颚能咬断骨头，爪子锋利得足以撕开比它们大许多倍的野兽的内脏。它们的大脑是本能和肾上腺素的爆炸，从高度感官中获得超自然的意识，但除了杀戮，几乎对其他一切都视而不见。它们可以直立行走以提高手部灵活性，也可以四肢并用以提高速度。据说它们的嚎叫能释放出狼的内在精神，这种令人毛骨悚然的声音会让空气中弥漫着雾气，让夜晚变得寒冷。犬科动物形态的狼人不会说人类语言，但似乎可以像野外的犬科动物一样，就狩猎、统治和社会等级制度等问题相互交流。",
	"If a werewolf dies in canid form, it changes back to human form, a process called death reversion.": "如果狼人以犬科动物的形态死亡，它就会变回人类形态，这个过程被称为死亡还原。",
	"The exact means by which a person is subjected to the curse of lycanthropy is unknown and clouded by superstition. It's likely that the curse can be imposed by a variety of different means—including intentional participation in a ritual meant to invoke the curse. Sometimes, it seems that a werewolf howlpack chooses a victim; certainly, most victims share a common experience of being called to join the pack.": "一个人受到变狼诅咒的确切方式尚不清楚，也被迷信所蒙蔽。诅咒很可能是通过各种不同的方式施加的--包括故意参加某种仪式来召唤诅咒。有时，狼人狼群似乎会选择一个受害者；当然，大多数受害者都有被召唤加入狼群的共同经历。",
	"Werewolves are often lone hunters, stalking and killing humans as singular monsters in towns and villages. But some werewolves form loose social groups in the wild, called howlpacks. The population of any howlpack waxes and wanes like the moon, gaining and losing members as individual lycanthropes enter or leave their canid state. Some werewolves seem to be continually drawn back to a familiar howlpack, returning to it time after time as they drop their human guise to reenter the wild.": "狼人通常是孤独的猎手，他们在城镇和村庄中作为单独的怪物跟踪并杀害人类。但有些狼人会在野外组成松散的社会群体，称为 \"狼群\"。任何狼群的数量都会像月亮一样时多时少，随着个别狼人进入或离开他们的犬科动物状态，狼群的成员也会增加或减少。有些狼人似乎会不断地被吸引回熟悉的狼群，当他们卸下人类的伪装重返野外时，又会一次又一次地回到狼群。",
	"Howlpacks can be tiny hunting parties of just a few werewolves or massive hordes of over a hundred beasts. They are typically led by single alphas (male or female) that dominate the pack. Alphas must often defend their power by defeating challengers in combat.": "狼群可以是由几只狼人组成的小型狩猎队，也可以是由上百只狼人组成的庞大狼群。它们通常由支配狼群的单个首领（男性或女性）领导。首领通常必须通过在战斗中击败挑战者来捍卫自己的权力。",
	"Ghoulcallers are necromancers—mages who use black mana to call forth the dead from graveyards. These risen dead are called ghouls, or the unhallowed. The ghoulcaller fills the fragile mind of his or her creation with a single driving purpose, which the ghoul carries out to the best of its ability using whatever skills it has. The result is a grotesque parody of life: risen blacksmiths attempting to \"reforge\" their opponents, fallen warriors rasping incoherent battle cries, undead murderers reawakening their deadly slyness, and fallen mages trying to weave spells that often result in some horrible distortion of their original purpose.": "食尸鬼召唤师是使用黑法力从墓地召唤亡灵的死灵法师。这些复活的亡灵被称为食尸鬼，或未受诅咒者。食尸鬼召唤师在他或她创造的食尸鬼脆弱的心灵中灌注了一个唯一的驱动目的，食尸鬼会尽其所能地使用它所拥有的任何技能来实现这个目的。其结果是对生命的怪诞模仿：复活的铁匠试图 \"重新锻造 \"他们的对手，堕落的战士发出语无伦次的战斗呐喊，不死的杀人犯重新唤醒他们致命的狡猾，堕落的法师试图编织法术，结果往往是对其原始目的的可怕扭曲。",
	"The clergy of Avacyn perform rituals on the final resting places of the dead to ensure the Blessed Sleep, but during Avacyn's time in the Helvault, ghoulcallers had an easier time in their work. In this present age of Avacyn's madness, not only are necromancers easily able to plunder the graves of the fallen, but ghouls seem to arise spontaneously from graves across Innistrad.": "阿瓦辛的神职人员会在亡者最后的安息之地举行仪式，以确保 \"受祝福的沉睡\"，但在阿瓦辛的地狱时代，食尸鬼召唤者的工作更加轻松。在阿瓦辛疯狂的当今时代，不仅死灵法师可以轻易地掠夺亡者的坟墓，食尸鬼似乎也会自发地从整个因尼斯特拉德的坟墓中出现。",
	"The (%0%) in the (%1%) describe the most common ghouls of Innistrad. More powerful necromancers might raise unhallowed dead with the statistics of (%2%), (%3%), (%4%), or (%5%).": "(%1%) 中的 (%0%) 描述了因尼斯特拉德最常见的食尸鬼。更强大的死灵法师可能会召唤出统计数字为 (%2%)、(%3%)、(%4%) 或 (%5%) 的不详亡灵。",
	"Ghouls also include zombie animals, often animated by necromancers to serve as familiars—most commonly (%0%), (%1%), and (%2%). These creatures have the statistics of the small animals in the (%3%), with the addition of the zombie's Undead Fortitude trait.": "食尸鬼还包括僵尸动物，它们通常会被亡灵巫师变成熟悉的动物--最常见的有（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。这些动物的统计数据与 (%3%) 中的小型动物相同，但增加了僵尸的亡灵坚韧特质。",
