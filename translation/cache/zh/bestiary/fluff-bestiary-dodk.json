	"Friedrich von Lichten has fully embraced (%0%) and transformed into a monster, and is now the Pale Man (see Appendix A of(%1%)for game statistics). He has maintained his intellect, and drapes his hunched and withered figure in a black cloak. Beneath his paper-thin skin are wriggling and writhing things. His lidless eyes are sunken, his teeth are prominent, yellowing and decaying. One can just make out a sickly green tongue that darts out when he speaks. He talks in a stunted, almost exasperated tone.": "弗里德里希-冯-利希滕完全接受了 (%0%) 并变成了怪物，现在他是苍白人（游戏统计数据请参见附录 A 的 (%1%)）。他还保持着智力，驼背枯瘦的身躯披着黑色斗篷。在他薄如纸片的皮肤下，有一些蠕动的东西。他无神的双眼深陷，牙齿突出，发黄腐烂。他说话时伸出的绿色舌头令人作呕。他说话的语气呆滞，近乎恼怒。",

When he meets a transformed or contaminated creature, he presents himself as a helpful expert, offering to treat any individual left in his care.

The Pale Man spends most of his time in the repurposed master bedroom of the estate he uses as his laboratory, and gives orders only to his most trusted thralls.": "苍白人散布谣言，说他可以帮助受污染的人，从而把他们当作实验对象。当他遇到变异生物或被污染的生物时，他就会把自己打扮成一个乐于助人的专家，愿意治疗任何由他照顾的人。他从未真正治愈过病人（%0%），但有时会帮助其他变异怪物变得清醒一些，这样他就能更好地利用这些怪物作为爪牙。苍白人大部分时间都待在他用作实验室的庄园主卧里，只对他最信任的手下发号施令。",

As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.": "盗贼女王是一个诡计多端的主谋，控制着德拉肯海姆的黑社会。她将上百个争斗不休的强盗和不法之徒变成了一个蓬勃发展的犯罪帝国。然而，没有人知道她的真实身份或出身，因为她有很多面孔。虽然她最著名的形象是一个身形矫健的蒙面女子，身着潇洒的装束，头戴宽边帽，手持镶满珠宝的剑柄，但盗贼女王会根据心情和环境的不同，采用不同的装束、面部特征、皮肤和头发颜色、体型、年龄和性别。因此，她通常会通过透露与她交谈的人的一些秘密来确认自己的身份，或者展示她似乎可以随意改变外貌的神奇能力。",

Kill!\"": "一双闪烁着黄紫色光芒的眼睛出现在前方黑暗的隧道中，然后是另一双，接着是更多。一群毛茸茸的躯体裹着沾满泥巴的布和油腻的皮革向前奔跑。它们啮齿类动物般的爪子挥舞着锈迹斑斑的刀片，吱吱喳喳的声音此起彼伏，唧唧喳喳，尖叫声不绝于耳，最后是 \"杀！杀！杀！\"的嚎叫声！杀！杀！",

Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but love eating people. They especially love eating babies. While they will subsist on carrion, ratlings take captives back to their lairs so they can have fresh food later. Thousands of ratlings dwell in the city. They form warring colonies that dig maze-like burrows featuring multiple entrances and tight looping passages. Successful colonies grow in number quickly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available.": "鼠人是超大型的变异老鼠，充满了邪恶的狡猾，被疯狂的吞噬和繁殖所驱使。这些可恶的怪物在懦弱的生存本能和暴力的冲动之间不断进行着内心的挣扎。鼠人梦想吃掉一切，什么都吃，但最喜欢吃人。它们尤其喜欢吃婴儿。虽然它们会以腐肉为生，但鼠人也会把俘虏带回自己的巢穴，以便以后能吃到新鲜的食物。城市里居住着成千上万的鼠人。它们组成交战群，挖掘迷宫般的洞穴，洞穴有多个入口和紧密的环形通道。成功的鼠群数量增长很快，因为在有充足食物和谵妄的情况下，鼠仔在几周内就能成熟。",
