He has penetrated deeply into the Nine Hells and intends to throw his host of demons at one of the devils' great flying strongholds to slaughter as many of his enemies as possible. The demons know they will die in the attack, but since they're not native to the Nine Hells it is of no consequence. Their bodies will simply reform in the Abyss. The devils that they kill will die forever.": "高原上的营地是恶魔领主（%0%）的战争营地（见多元宇宙中的怪物）。他已经深入九幽地狱，打算把他的恶魔主力投向恶魔们的一个巨大飞行据点，尽可能多地屠杀他的敌人。恶魔们知道自己会在攻击中死亡，但由于他们不是九幽地狱的原住民，所以这并不重要。他们的尸体会在深渊中简单改造。被他们杀死的恶魔将永远死去。",

	"Baphomet desires to draw the citadel to this location whereupon he plans to trigger an overly complicated assault, the details of which the characters don't need to know. He simply needs them to locate the nearest citadel and attract its attention, so it diverts towards the camp. As a reward, Baphomet offers a chest full of 5,000 gp once the characters return with a citadel on its way.

If they've any interest in saving those unfortunates, the characters need to locate the citadel for Baphomet.": "巴弗灭指着冥河对岸的土地，建议他们从那里开始寻找。此时，角色们可以自由离开，很容易就能绕两圈回到 (%0%) 的驳船上，而且肯定能逃出生天，不过这样一来，被俘虏的人类就只能任由恶魔摆布了。如果他们有兴趣拯救这些不幸的人，就必须找到巴弗灭的城堡。",
	"Baphomet assembled his camp at this location, knowing it was near a devil patrol route, so locating a citadel won't be difficult. After (%0%) hours the characters see a citadel on the horizon. Any activity out of the ordinary attracts the attention of the citadel's crew (a spell or other visually impressive distraction suffices). Once it begins moving towards them it is easy for the characters to keep ahead of the citadel and reach the camp and Baphomet's tent before it arrives. Baphomet is ecstatic at their success, though distracted at the impending battle. He gestures to their reward and then exits his tent. Through the open flap, the characters watch the citadel's arrival.": "巴弗灭在这里扎营，因为他知道这里靠近魔鬼巡逻路线，所以找到一座城堡并不困难。(%0%) 小时后，角色们在地平线上看到了一座城堡。任何不寻常的活动都会引起堡垒船员的注意（一个咒语或其他视觉干扰就足够了）。一旦城堡开始向他们移动，角色们很容易就能保持领先，在城堡到达之前到达营地和巴弗灭的帐篷。巴弗灭为他们的成功而欣喜若狂，尽管即将到来的战斗让他心烦意乱。他对他们的奖励做了个手势，然后走出了帐篷。透过敞开的挡板，角色们看到了城堡的到来。",

Moving through the ranks requires either manipulating the strict laws of the realm, betraying comrades, or commanders—or sometimes both. Devils that find themselves higher in the hierarchy tend to lead relatively comfortable lives, so long as they obey their superiors and maintain a steady stream of souls.

In this rift lie buried many weapons left over from the Blood War.": "雷克蕾克斯卡拉已经知道了一件千年前为终结大乱斗而设计的地狱神器的位置。这件神器是一个号角，可以让恶魔在阿弗纳斯聆听恶魔的想法，即使是强大的恶魔领主也不例外。这种物品对凡人冒险者来说毫无价值，但对大恶魔来说却具有无上的价值，比如 (%0%)。雷克塞斯卡拉会用 10 个灵魂金币来购买号角。此外，他还会为每个角色提供一小瓶凝结的秩序（(%1%)。除了该物质的正常效果外，它还能让他们在离开战争沼泽时不需要先进行智慧蓄力。最后，他研究战争沼泽已有数百年之久，可以就如何在其中寻找物品提供建议。如果角色们同意他的条件，雷克斯特雷斯卡拉就会给他们一张通往战争沼泽深处裂缝的地图（揭示地狱地图上的 W4 区域）。裂缝中埋藏着许多血战遗留下来的武器。",
	"He will also answer questions from the characters if they agree to his task or he feels his life is threatened.": "如果角色同意他的任务，或者他觉得自己的生命受到威胁，他也会回答角色的问题。",
	"If the characters ask him for help in finding the phylactery of the queen, he says that they will find it at an abandoned tower which is located deep within the War-Slough. It dates from a time when the War-Slough was much smaller.": "如果角色们请他帮忙寻找女王的法器，他说他们会在战争沼泽深处的一座废弃塔楼里找到它。这座塔的历史可以追溯到战争沼泽小得多的时候。",

	"The characters notice the tower when they get within 300 feet of it. It was built centuries ago to guard the borders of the War-Slough when it was much smaller. Now the top floor of the tower is the roost of a marilith. She wraps her snake body around an infernal throne, a remnant from the Blood War. The throne allows a Fiend to control lesser devils as if its occupant were at the top of the infernal hierarchy. The marilith, a demon, uses it to amuse herself by having all the devils in the region perform whatever whim comes into her head. The marilith is easier to defeat if the characters enter the tower without her knowing, but there are several obstacles to achieving that.": "当角色们走到离塔 300 英尺的范围内时，他们就会注意到这座塔。这座塔建于几百年前，当时是为了守卫沃尔斯洛夫的边界，当时沃尔斯洛夫还小得多。现在，塔的顶层是玛利莉丝的栖息地。她用蛇身缠绕着血战遗留下来的地狱王座。王座可以让恶魔控制较小的恶魔，就好像王座的主人是地狱的最高统治者一样。玛利莉丝是一个恶魔，她用它来娱乐自己，让该地区的所有恶魔执行她脑海中的任何奇思妙想。如果角色在她不知情的情况下进入塔中，就比较容易打败玛利莉丝，但要做到这一点有几个障碍。",
	"The first obstacle is a half dozen barbed devils and a half dozen bearded devils marching back and forth along the road to the entrance. If observed, they're seemingly following orders that only they hear. They'll attack anyone that they see, but it is easy to avoid them when they're marching away from the tower. When first discovered they're 90 feet away from the tower and marching back towards it. Every turn, there is a (%0%) chance they reverse direction.

If these devils engage in combat with the characters, each round, one devil attempts to (%2%) back to the tower at \"A\" and if any devil reaches it, this obstacle is considered failed.": "第一个障碍是半打带刺的魔鬼和半打长胡子的魔鬼沿着通往入口的道路来回行进。如果有人观察，他们似乎在执行只有他们自己才能听到的命令。它们会攻击任何看到的人，但当它们远离塔楼行进时，很容易避开它们。第一次发现它们时，它们距离塔 90 英尺，正向塔后方行进。每转一圈，它们都有 (%0%) 的几率逆转方向。任何噪音都会使它们 (%1%) 向分心的方向移动，但它们不会理会头顶上发生的任何事情，因为它们毕竟只是步兵。如果这些魔鬼与角色交战，每回合都会有一个魔鬼试图（%2%）返回 \"A \"处的塔楼，如果有魔鬼到达，则视为障碍失败。",

If any shadow demons reach the throne room, this obstacle is considered failed. If discovered, the shadow demons attack the characters.": "最后一个障碍位于塔内。塔内大部分是空荡荡的废墟，只有一条简单的石阶向上延伸。但是 (%0%) (%1%) 会在楼梯上标有 \"B \"的每个位置徘徊（见 \"废塔 \"地图）。这些暗影恶魔试图躲避人物，如果没有被发现，它们就会爬到下一个 \"B\"（如果已经到达最上面的 \"B\"，则会爬到 \"王座厅\"）。如果有影子恶魔到达王座厅，则视为障碍失败。如果被发现，影魔会攻击角色。",

	"Once aware of them, the marilith and her devil courtiers mock the characters. They do this until the intruders attempt to leave or show any sort of disrespect, then they attack. If the marilith is killed her body vanishes and she appears on her throne (%0%) rounds later with 100 hit points. Only by destroying the throne can she be killed. The throne has an AC of 15 and 100 hit points.": "一旦发现他们，玛丽莉丝和她的魔鬼臣子就会嘲笑这些角色。直到入侵者试图离开或表现出任何不敬，他们才会发动攻击。如果玛利莉丝被杀死，她的身体就会消失，然后她会以 100 点命中率出现在她的王座上（%0%）。只有摧毁王座才能杀死她。王座的 AC 值为 15，命中率为 100。",

As the servant glances your way, it topples the bucket of dirtied water beside it. The water rolls out, hissing as it evaporates against the stone floor. The queen shrieks and chides the servant for being a clumsy fool and orders it to refill the bucket. The servant's shoulders slump as it retrieves the bucket. The face of the servant is strangely familiar.": "一个衣衫褴褛的仆人在王座底部洗地板，王座上坐着一位身着皇家紫色长袍、头戴闪亮王冠的蛇蝎美人。当仆人瞥向你的时候，它推翻了旁边的脏水桶。水滚了出来，在石板地上蒸发时发出嘶嘶声。王后尖叫着责备仆人笨手笨脚，命令他重新装满水。仆人拿回水桶时，肩膀耷拉了下来。仆人的面孔非常熟悉。",

At its center is an island that resembles a massive ant nest with entrances to caves or perhaps burrows. The smoke, haze, and muck make it nearly impossible to discern whether creatures occupy the tunnels below.": "一个巨大的圆形裂缝向沼泽深处延伸了 100 英尺。恶魔之液的小溪从裂口边缘倾泻而下。在这个污秽之地的底部，战争沼泽的恶魔之液汇聚成了一个大湖，湖水沸腾、冒泡，充满了无尽的恶意和可能性。湖中心有一座小岛，像一个巨大的蚂蚁窝，岛上有洞穴入口，也可能是洞穴。烟雾、雾霾和淤泥让人几乎无法辨别下面的隧道中是否有生物。",

This heart pumps demonic ichor into the blood vessels permeating these caverns.": "你面前是一个巨大的冰湖，随着恶魔的节奏起伏，声音越来越大。沿着湖岸，你看到一个小恶魔从淤泥中爬了出来，它的手臂上布满了几十个眼球。它没有理会你，摇摇晃晃地走下一条隧道。在这片怪异的大地上有一座小岛，岛上有一颗大象般大小的心脏。这颗心脏将恶魔的淤血泵入这些洞穴的血管中。",

It is described by visitors as impossibly large and yet cramped at the same time. Like the Iron Road, its buildings are constructed from a mix of cobblestone and burning iron, both mined from the mountains of the realm.

Enough that meltwater is constantly flowing into them, carving runnels on the floor and trickling inwards so that all the caves resound to the music of it, further confusing the suggestion of life and voices from below. The keen-eyed visitor might feel that signs of habitation at the cave-mouth seem oddly shallow and staged but by then it may be too late. Every visitor drawn to the cave mouth feels a powerful fascination with the depths, a need to know what is down there, the certainty that what they seek can be found below.

	"Progressing downwards from the abandoned structures at the cave mouth the visitor finds a maze of twisting ice tunnels, slippery with the constant run of meltwater, and from this point they're observed.

Their theology is entirely unique, quite separate from their usual deities. They worship that which lies deeper within the caves and have constructed a whole idiolectic myth-cycle to account for their presence in the Chasm, which they see as the center of a cold and uncaring universe.

Rambling accounts speak of too many arms, long-fingered hands, a twisted wedge of a head with a vertical mouth bristling with needle teeth. And a voice. A quiet, reasonable (so very reasonable) voice that speaks to mortals about salvation, rest, and peace—all the promises that lured them down into the caves past all those other tribulations. To forlorn devils, the Keeper instead whispers of a great and endless order, a perfect moment of torment perpetually prolonged. The Keeper has only terrible things to say, and yet it is hideously persuasive. Every moment of the journey through the caves goes to prepare its visitors to accept its blandishments. The Congregation's nonsense theology, the Echoes, the tentacled monsters thrashing blindly in the depths, all plant the seeds of surrender in the mind.": "什么是 \"发现之物的守护者\"？当然不是魔鬼。它是一种古老的东西，居住在峡谷中，看管着峡谷中的藏品，其时间比地狱的记录还要久远。即使是最敏锐的眼睛，也无法看清它的细节或完整地了解它。漫无边际的描述中提到了太多的手臂、长指头的手、扭曲的楔形头颅和长满针牙的垂直嘴巴。还有一个声音。一个安静、合理（非常合理）的声音，向凡人诉说着救赎、安息与和平--所有这些都是引诱他们下到洞穴里，越过所有其他磨难的承诺。而对于孤独无助的魔鬼，守护者却低声诉说着伟大而无尽的秩序，完美的折磨时刻永远在延长。守护者只会说可怕的话，但却具有可怕的说服力。在穿越洞穴的旅途中，每时每刻都在为游客接受它的诱惑做准备。 公理会的无稽神学、回声、在深海中盲目挣扎的触手怪，都在心中埋下了投降的种子。",

There are treasures that have washed down with the meltwater or that have been brought by great heroes and devils. There are monsters, trapped forever—dimly glimpsed against the strange flat light that emanates from every direction. And there are the mortals and devils, hundreds of them, who came this far and no farther. Who couldn't resist the soft entreaties of the Keeper. Here is rest and peace and an endless perfect cruelty. Over time the ice draws its captives deeper, to become the most recent prizes the Keeper claims. Anyone who travels to the end of the Chasm must make a (%0%) Constitution saving throw.

	"For those of stronger will, the ice itself reaches for them. The Keeper reshapes the very stuff of the Chasm to entrap less compliant victims by drawing forth frozen golems, gleaming facets flickering with echoes drawn from their victims' past.

In addition, they happily modify Fiends and even mortals. They replace and add limbs, senses, and organs, both on request from those seeking greater personal power, and to fulfill specific punishments for recalcitrant Fiends that (%0%) sends to them.

	"When mortals do beg their services, the required payment varies. Most often they might simply ask for one member of the visiting group—as a plaything, for their soul, or to trade on to some fiendish creditor. As mortals are oddly reluctant to enter into that kind of transaction, they take other services. There is almost always some rare component one or another sister is after for her latest creation, and they've devised a variety of powerful geas-type bindings to ensure that any agreement isn't reneged on. They particularly like effects that have their errand-runners gradually mutate or deteriorate the longer the task remains undone.

Except, of course, nothing in the Nine Hells is as good as it appears.": "店主 Vaness 和 Fling 提供的服务在整个马拉多明--事实上是整个九层地狱--都是独一无二的。他们提供的服务能让人从地狱的骇人压迫中解脱出来。他们让人们看到了幸福和奇迹，这些积极的东西让火魔和凡人都受益匪浅。在如此腐朽的环境中，能找到这样一块奇异的宝地，真是难能可贵。当然，九幽地狱里的一切都不像表面上那么美好。",

Fling, in contrast, is an (%1%) (see Monsters of the Multiverse), a mind flayer long gone on their peculiar path to lichdom. It acts as surgeon, implanting Vaness' creations and connecting them to the brains of its patients/ customers. They make a strange and jarring pair, not least because of their manner. Vaness and Fling strike the unwary as an old married couple, constantly bantering back and forth, making jokes at one another's expense, and exploding into arguments that settle almost instantaneously. It seems impossible that either creature could actually form a real bond, but to all intents and purposes the pair seem genuinely attached. Which often serves to lull visitors into a false sense of security. Vaness and Fling have not survived the Nine Hells for so long by being nice. They're as ruthless and powerful as any other infernal magnates, able to defend themselves physically if need be, but preferring to rely on their minions, treaties with the gangs and, if necessary, protection from Akrekarn and his posse.

When a newly altered customer wakes from the surgery, the dome above them is complete, its ceiling ornate and painted with frescoes of surpassing loveliness. Vaness and Fling are elegant and dignified, the master-surgeon and the genial artificer, surrounded by their immaculate staff.

Moreover, everyone who leaves the Eye Market having conducted business with Vaness and Fling becomes a target. All those waiting outside would give a great deal more than their eyes to get hold of such things, even though the services of Fling would still be required to implant them.

They leave fissures and cracks miles deep in their wake, which are quickly covered by snowbanks, awaiting unknowing victims who then fall to their deaths.": "除了冰层之外，陡峭的山脉也划破了卡尼亚的天空。它们的面孔嶙峋而无情，雪崩的声音几乎不绝于耳。与山峰相伴的是移动的冰川和冰山，它们刻画了这里的地貌。这些巨大的冰川似乎有自己的生命，在这片土地上蜿蜒穿行，不时相互碰撞或撞向山脉，形成壮观的冰雪爆炸。它们留下的裂痕和裂缝深达数英里，很快就被雪堆覆盖，等待着不知情的受害者摔死。",

Only by navigating the Styx from its first entrance into Cania can a captain find the exit—otherwise, some form of magic keeps the edge of Cania hidden and the river goes on indefinitely.

Beings of the earliest creation, when the many planes of the universe were still coming together, possessed of a might and craft no longer seen. As the greatest of giants often will, they fell into a dispute with the elder gods of the time. A war followed, fit to tear the firmament down and sunder the planes. And, in the end, they lost and were hunted across creation by the vengeful gods. In the height of their desperation, the giants made a foolish deal with the lords of the lower planes.

Hundreds of gigantic frozen figures, receding back into the ice until they're just shadows.": "您走近一片巨大的冰川，它距离冰冻平原有三英里，其上游被卡尼亚永恒之风不断吹过的流云所拂动。冰面被阴影笼罩，褪了色。你似乎能看到它的形状，也许是偶然出现的自然光影。但这种效果并不是光线的把戏。这里是阿纳金巨人，镶嵌在冰层中。他们是冰川的峭壁 他们肩并肩，脚尖到脚跟，衣衫褴褛，巨大的身躯因长期逃避神的惩罚而憔悴不堪。手里攥着破破烂烂的包袱，可能是随身物品，也可能是孩子。数以百计的巨大冰冻人影，渐渐退入冰层，直到只剩下影子。",

	"The mere fact and sight of the Heights of Anakim is enough to bring mortals to their knees, but it gets worse. Whilst devils aren't averse to the idea of just leaving things to be tormented forever, they found a use for the giants. So it is that the sharp-eyed visitor scanning the upper reaches of that appalling cliff finds scaffolding and gantries and excavation. Tunnels and quarries that carve into the literal faces of the giants to get at the treasure within.": "光是看到阿纳金高地的事实就足以让凡人屈服，但情况更糟。虽然魔鬼们并不排斥让事物永远受折磨的想法，但他们还是为巨人找到了用武之地。因此，眼尖的游客在骇人悬崖的上游会发现脚手架、龙门架和挖掘机。隧道和采石场在巨人的脸上开凿，以获取里面的宝藏。",

A huddle of buildings, mostly carved from ice, built around one vast hall raised from iron interlayered with the hides of long-extinct monsters, where the raw giant-stuff is rendered down into sorrow wine. Beyond, the cliff face itself is cut and carved with multiple zig-zagging paths up to the heights, along with winches and lifts to take miners up, and bring the yield down. In the town dwells a variety of devils seldom seen elsewhere in Cania who deal with the administration of the mining efforts, the constant infernal accountancy of supply and demand and a modicum of trading with visitors.": "在阿纳金高地的山脚下（字面意思），有一个小镇。建筑群大多由冰块雕刻而成，围绕着一个巨大的大厅，大厅由铁皮和早已灭绝的怪兽的兽皮拼接而成。此外，崖壁本身也被切割和雕刻成多条之字形小路，通往高处，还有绞盘和升降机，将矿工送上去，再将成品带下来。镇子里住着卡尼亚其他地方很少见的各种魔鬼，他们负责管理采矿工作，不断核算供需关系，并与游客进行少量交易。",

The baron is an ice devil of twice the usual size, emaciated and hunched almost double, usually to be seen squatting on a spider-legged throne formed from an enslaved ice Elemental. Klendisk's public face is that of a monstrous tyrant, cruel in his discipline towards other gelugons and doubly so to any other devil breeds. Behind closed doors, he is a devil with a problem, because mining the giants and producing the sorrow wine is difficult and his own master brooks no excuses. Hence, while a terror to other devils, Klendisk is known to at least give a hearing to outsiders with a solution.": "小镇本身由避免从事这种琐碎工作的吉鲁贡人监管，并由一位名叫克兰迪斯克的男爵（（%0%），拥有 250 点命中率）指挥，他直接向（%1%）汇报工作。男爵是一个体型是普通人两倍的冰雪恶魔，憔悴不堪，几乎驼背了一倍，通常会蹲在一个由被奴役的冰元素形成的蜘蛛腿王座上。克伦迪斯克的公众形象是一个畸形暴君，他对其他冰巨魔严加管教，对任何其他恶魔品种更是如此。关起门来，他是一个有问题的魔鬼，因为开采巨人和酿造悲哀之酒都很困难，他自己的主人也不允许有任何借口。因此，虽然克伦迪斯克让其他魔鬼闻风丧胆，但它至少会听取外人的意见，并给出解决方案。",
	"The difficulty is in the very nature of the stuff they mine. The raw seams of misery in the brains of the giants are powerfully destructive. Whilst Klendisk has no compunction about destroying souls or mortal prisoners, the cold of Cania and the corrosive nature of the misery destroys such tools before they can be of much use. Infernal labor has other problems. Contact with the giant-stuff makes them drunk: boisterous and leery with the heady misery of ages. A fiendish workforce would fall to squabbling, brawling and unacceptable indiscipline, even the icy gelugons themselves. It is a pitiful devil that needs to go beg outside help but that is the situation that Klendisk often finds himself in.": "困难在于他们挖掘的东西的本质。巨人大脑中的苦难原缝具有强大的破坏力。虽然克伦迪斯克毫不犹豫地摧毁灵魂或凡人囚犯，但卡尼亚的寒冷和苦难的腐蚀性会在这些工具派上用场之前就将其摧毁。地狱劳工还有其他问题。与巨物的接触会让他们醉生梦死：在令人兴奋的岁月苦难中，他们变得躁动不安。一个恶魔般的劳动力会陷入争吵、斗殴和不可接受的无纪律状态，就连冰冷的凝胶人自己也不例外。这是一个可怜的魔鬼，需要去乞求外界的帮助，但这就是克兰迪斯克经常遇到的情况。",
	"Though these mines would seem to be a good place to avoid, mortal travelers do visit. It helps that Cania has few other locales to recommend it, and the town at the foot of the Heights does at least have shelter and goods for trade. Sometimes mortals are sent there by other Fiends, seeking to abstract some of the processed sorrow wine for their own delectation or trade. Klendisk's ice devils keep a compound eye out for strangers, though, and anyone who comes to their attention without a good excuse or permits signed in triplicate find themselves introduced to the mines or the vats in swift order, or else claimed by Klendisk for a little informal torment. Assignment to the Heights is short on entertainment.": "虽然这些矿场似乎是个避之不及的好地方，但凡人旅行者还是会光顾。这是因为卡尼亚几乎没有其他值得推荐的地方，而高地脚下的小镇至少有栖身之所和交易物品。有时，其他火魔也会派凡人去那里，试图提取一些加工过的悲酒，供自己享用或交易。不过，克伦迪克的冰雪恶魔会密切注意陌生人，任何没有正当理由或没有签署一式三份的许可证就来打扰他们的人，都会被迅速介绍到矿场或大桶里，否则就会被克伦迪克认领，进行一番非正式的折磨。派往高地的任务缺乏娱乐性。",
	"Usually, visitors simply stay long enough to turn a profit and then leave. Others hang on too long or try to claw too much from Klendisk. When his temper breaks, he loses all perspective and has them destroyed or cast out into Cania's killing cold.": "通常情况下，游客只是停留足够长的时间，赚取利润，然后离开。其他游客则在此逗留太久，或试图从克伦迪斯克身上攫取太多利益。一旦他的脾气暴躁起来，他就会失去所有的理智，将他们摧毁或扔到卡尼亚的杀戮寒风中。",
	"Currently there are two major contractors working at the face, and one more running the rendering shed. Both mining contractors, Kargan and Cornelius, have a constant need of specialist materials—necromantic or machine components—and anyone bringing in fresh stocks will find favor with one (and attract the ire of the other). Alternatively, particularly wicked mortals with a solution to Klendisk's labor problems are always assured a hearing. The mines can always use a new contractor. For the price of 300 gp per day, Klendisk is willing to grant a dispensation to the characters so that they may attempt to work the mines.": "目前，有两个主要承包商在工作面工作，还有一个承包商负责渲染棚。卡根和科尼利厄斯这两家采矿承包商都不断需要专业材料--非魔法材料或机器部件--任何带来新材料的人都会得到其中一家的青睐（同时也会招致另一家的不满）。另外，如果有特别邪恶的凡人能解决克兰迪斯克的劳动力问题，也一定会得到他们的青睐。矿场总是需要新的承包商。只要每天支付 300 古普，克兰迪斯克就愿意给予这些人物豁免权，让他们尝试在矿场工作。",
	"In the Sorrow Mines most of the workforce is either Undead or made of metal. However, there are still plenty of devils roaming about, many of them are under the influence of the sorrow wine. Imbibing too much doesn't always end well for the devil in question. The prison at the edge of Klendisk's Fort houses those unfortunate devils whose liquid bravado provoked Klendisk's wrath. It is run by chain devils with several prisoners of little importance currently housed in the cells.": "在悲伤矿井中，大部分劳动力都是亡灵或金属制造的。不过，仍有许多恶魔四处游荡，其中许多人都受到了悲哀之酒的影响。饮酒过多的恶魔通常不会有好下场。克兰迪斯克要塞边缘的监狱关押着那些因逞能而激怒克兰迪斯克的不幸魔鬼。监狱由链魔管理，目前牢房里关押着几名无关紧要的囚犯。",

He has made a number of large claims to Klendisk about how his machinery will revolutionize the mining at the Heights and is now finding that even golems and automata can be ground down by the weight of misery. Cornelius is less suited to Cania than most of the inhabitants of this mining town, so he tends to spend most of his time here, in his very warm home. His Constructs keep him informed and alert him to any problems in production.": "科尼利厄斯-布拉斯格雷夫（中性邪恶 (%0%)）是一名地精工匠，从凡人位面的十几个不同的地方被赶了出来，他是一个纯粹理性而没有道德的生物，他勤劳的实验毒化了海洋，将生机勃勃的大地变成了一片充满金属味道的荒地。他向克兰迪斯克大肆宣扬他的机器将如何彻底改变高地的采矿业，现在他发现即使是傀儡和自动人偶也会被痛苦的重压压垮。科尼利厄斯不像这个采矿小镇的大多数居民那样适合在卡尼亚生活，因此他倾向于把大部分时间花在这里，花在他温暖的家中。他的构造体随时向他汇报情况，并提醒他注意生产中出现的任何问题。",

In the absence of certainty, infernal rumor is that either these are, in some way, bad modrons who are being punished for crimes against lawfulness meaningless to others—or else the whole business is some grand experiment into the enduring nature of law. Certainly, individual workers eventually become corrupted by the work, sad little pieces of geometry infected with emotion, grinding to a halt as they're consumed by misery. At which point the Orthoclath casts them out, and the devils are free to devour or toy with them, not that the creatures give any real sport. There are always, apparently, more modrons ready to troop down from the lawful planes and give themselves to the work.": "modron 的参与早于 Klendisk 的任命，而魔鬼也殚精竭虑地试图查明他们的实际雇佣条件。在无法确定的情况下，坊间流传着这样一种说法：这些人要么是坏 modron，他们因对他人毫无意义的违反法律的罪行而受到惩罚；要么整个工作就是对法律的持久性进行的一次大实验。当然，个别工人最终会被工作所腐蚀，成为被情感所感染的可悲的几何体，在被痛苦吞噬后停滞不前。这时，Orthoclath 就会把他们赶出去，魔鬼们就可以自由地吞噬或玩弄他们了，但这些生物并没有真正地参与其中。显然，总有更多的魔龙准备从法则位面赶来，投入到这项工作中。",

These eyes rest above faces full of pain, with mouths drawn tight in grief or frozen open, midscream. But more haunting than the eyes of fear and rage are the eyes that contain nothing at all. No emotion. Just dull acceptance. There are shapes just above the eyes of some of these giants. As you draw closer, you think they might be caves and then you see the workers that scramble in and out of them and you realize that they're tunnels. Mines. Dug straight through the frozen heads of the dead.": "你首先注意到的是眼睛。每一双眼睛都是巨大的，与它们所处的巨大脸庞成正比。大多数眼睛都睁得大大的，惊恐万分，纯粹是毫不掩饰的恐惧。这些眼睛的上方是一张张充满痛苦的脸，有的因悲伤而紧闭着嘴，有的则张着大嘴，嚎啕大哭。但比恐惧和愤怒的眼睛更令人毛骨悚然的，是那些什么都不含的眼睛。没有情感。只有沉闷的接受。有些巨人的眼睛上方有一些形状。当你走近时，你会觉得它们可能是洞穴 然后你会看到工人们在洞穴里进进出出 你会意识到它们是隧道 地道 直接穿过死者冰冻的头颅",
	"There are more treasures than mere misery frozen in the glacier. The giants were artisans to the gods before they rebelled. They clutch in their colossal frozen arms treasures from elder ages, secrets on great withered scrolls, the raw stuff of creation stolen from divine workshops. An intrepid team of mortals might steal up the cliffs and into the mines where untold treasures wait to be unearthed deep in the heart of the ice. Even the spoil-heaps of the mines themselves glitter with discarded wonders, if only one can get to them. For while the devils care only for the misery and the wine they make from it, punishing errant thieves remains one of their few pleasures and they always look forward to the next visitors—mortals or devils—to try it.": "冰川中冻结的不仅仅是苦难，还有更多的宝藏。巨人在反抗之前是众神的工匠。他们用冰冻的巨臂紧紧抓住来自远古的宝藏、枯萎卷轴上的秘密，以及从神工坊偷来的创造之源。一队无畏的凡人可能会爬上悬崖，进入矿井，那里有数不尽的宝藏等待着在冰雪深处被发掘出来。只要有人能找到它们，就连矿场的废料堆里也会闪烁着被丢弃的奇珍异宝。虽然魔鬼们只关心苦难和从中酿出的美酒，但惩罚犯错的盗贼仍然是他们为数不多的乐趣之一，他们总是期待着下一个访客--魔鬼或死神--来尝试一下。",
	"The items of value these giants crafted aren't easily transported. If an entire day is spent excavating, the characters recover a 100-pound statue made of gold and gems (and worth (%0%) gp). However, this excavation draws the attention–and wrath–of the devils unless the baron has granted the characters a dispensation. A similar statue can be recovered with each day's effort, until (%1%) have been unearthed.": "这些巨人制作的贵重物品不易运输。如果花上一整天的时间挖掘，角色们就能找到一座用黄金和宝石打造的 100 磅重的雕像（价值 (%0%) gp）。然而，除非得到男爵的特许，否则这次发掘会引起恶魔的注意和愤怒。每天都可以发掘一座类似的雕像，直到发掘出 (%1%) 座雕像为止。",

Cornelius is at his home in the town below, but Kargan is almost always in the mine. She is a necromancer of considerable power and her solution to efficiently mining has been to use mindless Undead to do the brute work. She is constantly importing bones and cadavers from elsewhere in the planes, preferring to create ogre zombies and minotaur skeletons for the mining operation.

A lowly modron (chaotic neutral (%0%) with 50 hit points) has been corrupted by the overwhelming grief permeating the mines. It has gone rogue and skulks the shadows of the mines, pushing miners off scaffolding, or narrow rock bridges when it can.

	"Though the Styx freezes in its passage to Nessus, it doesn't completely dry up. Near the bottom, the temperature shift causes a small section of the river to melt and finish its journey to Nessus below. This stream is heavily guarded and flows a small distance before pooling into the Forgotten Lake, the last stop. From here, it drains into the porous stone of Nessus, traveling to the very bottom of the layer. It gurgles through a few of the deepest ravines before mysteriously vanishing on its journey to Gehenna.": "虽然冥河在前往内瑟斯的途中冻结了，但并没有完全干涸。在河底附近，温度的变化导致一小段河水融化，完成了通往下方奈瑟斯的旅程。这条小河戒备森严，流过一小段距离后汇入最后一站--遗忘湖。溪水从这里流入内瑟斯多孔的石头中，一直流到最底层。它潺潺流过几条最深的沟壑，然后神秘地消失在通往地狱的旅途中。",

Some scholars believe its pools are fed by the Styx itself, but the river's unique powers and secluded nature make such beliefs impossible to prove. From its spring in Nessus, the Lethe flows across the land, occasionally crossing ravines and canyons, before reaching the edge of the landmass. Unlike the Styx, the Lethe completely defies gravity, flowing over the cracks in the land without breaking its stride. It flows off the edge of Nessus unimpeded, where it continues to run off into the void, seemingly floating into the empty space.": "莱特河是冥河的近亲，发源于内瑟斯。一些学者认为它的水池是由冥河本身注入的，但这条河流独特的力量和隐秘的性质使得这种说法无从考证。莱特河从内瑟斯的泉水出发，流经整个陆地，偶尔会穿过峡谷，然后到达陆地的边缘。与冥河不同的是，莱特河完全无视地心引力，从大地的裂缝中流淌而过，丝毫没有中断。它不受阻碍地流出内瑟斯的边缘，继续流向虚空，似乎漂浮在空无一物的空间里。",

	"There are certainly threats that come to trouble those at the oasis. Inexplicable monsters sometimes undulate out of the red void—bizarre beasts never seen before and never replicated. Whilst they represent unparalleled opportunities for study, they also devour the occasional student. Desperate fugitive souls and marauding adventurers fleeing (%0%)'s pursuit occasionally find their way to the Oasis and make demands of the arch-magister Elihandrel, though thus far his magical abilities have sufficed to return them to the archdevil's custody in short order. Sometimes conjurations called up by the mages themselves get loose and have a brief career of havoc before they're banished once more. But from the devils of the Nine Hells themselves, there is no threat. They're as obliging as the most unctuous servants.": "当然，绿洲里也有威胁。红色的虚空中时不时会出现莫名其妙的怪兽，它们是前所未见的怪兽，也是无法复制的怪兽。虽然它们代表着无与伦比的学习机会，但也会吞噬偶尔出现的学生。绝望的逃亡者和躲避（%0%）追捕的冒险者偶尔也会来到绿洲，向大法师伊莱汉德尔提出要求，不过到目前为止，伊莱汉德尔的魔法能力足以让他们在短时间内回到大恶魔的监管之下。有时，法师们自己召唤出的幻象也会松动，在被再次放逐之前，他们会在短时间内大肆破坏。但是，九层地狱的恶魔本身并不构成威胁。它们就像最奸诈的仆人一样乐于助人。",

In contrast to the barren plane, it is green and verdant, thronging with life. There are trees meticulously trained together to form living buildings; there are pools of sparkling water that promise refreshment. Animals and birds dwell here, apparently without fear of mortal or devil. Lions and lambs, serpents and deer, all living in harmony.": "绿洲是一座浮岛，仿佛被神奇地拴在莱特河无尽的水流中，距离内瑟斯边缘一英里。与荒芜的平面形成鲜明对比的是，这里绿意盎然，生机勃勃。这里的树木经过精心修剪，形成了有生命的建筑；这里的水池波光粼粼，让人心旷神怡。动物和鸟类在此栖息，显然不惧凡人或魔鬼。狮子和羔羊，蛇和鹿，和谐共处。",
	"Within the buildings of the Oasis there are libraries that would make a sage weep, telescopes and scrying pools and all manner of divinatory instruments to look into Nessus and the river and the wider planes. There are debating rooms and places for quiet contemplation. Any mortal who has ever valued the pursuit of knowledge instantly feels that they've come home.": "在绿洲的建筑中，有让圣人流泪的图书馆，有望远镜、占卜池和各种占卜仪器，可以窥探内萨斯、河流和更广阔的空间。这里有辩论室，也有安静沉思的地方。任何重视知识追求的凡人都会立刻感觉到自己回到了家。",
	"Some of the planes' greatest minds can be found here studying the intrinsic nature of the cosmos—both the living who have made the arduous journey and the souls of the dead.

There are other incautious mortals who fall into (%0%)'s power, but the majority of souls in his domain are those drawn to the Nine Hells by the choices they made in life. However, the arch-magister of the Oasis, Elihandrel (use (%1%) stats but Elihandrel is Medium sized), keeps order. His word is law, as much as (%2%)'s is within Malsheem.

	"Elihandrel himself is an ageless high elf, robed in simple grey. He appears mild, confident in his authority and power, proud of the peaceful community he has built. His soft-spoken word is the end of any disagreements, ensuring that those under his charge never let civilized debate get out of hand. His guests have everything they need—the trees bear endlessly nutritious fruit and there are always books, tools, and scholars' supplies of surpassing quality. He even sanctions research expeditions to other layers of the Nine Hells. At his beck and call are a staff of curiously meek devils, still monstrous of aspect but on their very best behavior. Elihandrel himself reports to (%0%) on a regular basis, sharing all the knowledge that his faculty uncovers. He denies that he is in any way enabling evil. Learning, he insists, is without alignment. His ultimate goal is to push past the adversarial model of the universe that has trapped all life in constant conflict, law against chaos, good against evil. He genuinely believes that a full understanding of the planes can lead to a perfect future without hardship or sin.": "伊莱汉德尔本人是一位不老的高等精灵，身着简单的灰色长袍。他看起来很温和，对自己的权威和权力充满信心，为自己建立的和平社区感到自豪。他轻声细语的话语是任何分歧的终结，确保他手下的人不会让文明的辩论失控。他的客人们应有尽有--树上结着无穷无尽的营养果实，书本、工具和学者用品也总是质量上乘。他甚至还批准到九层地狱的其他地层进行研究考察。他的手下有一群奇怪而温顺的魔鬼，他们仍然是怪物，但表现得非常好。伊莱汉德尔本人定期向（%0%）汇报工作，分享他的团队发现的所有知识。他否认自己以任何方式助长了邪恶。他坚持认为，学习是不对等的。 他的终极目标是突破宇宙的对抗模式，这种模式让所有生命陷入不断的冲突之中，法律对抗混乱，正义对抗邪恶。他真诚地相信，对宇宙的全面了解可以带来一个没有艰难险阻、没有罪恶的完美未来。",
	"Elihandrel is very eager to spread word of his faculty out into the wider planes. He maintains correspondence with a number of temples, universities, and mage schools on the mortal planes. Whilst the appeal of studying the secrets of the Nine Hells is plain to evil mages and luminaries of all kinds, Elihandrel is very keen to maintain balance by attracting those of other aspects as well. He writes persuasively of the possibility of studying the heart of evil with an eye to countering its influences. One must truly understand a thing before one can defeat it, is his frequent refrain. Scholars visiting the Oasis from the mortal planes find the opportunities of the place overwhelming. There is always something new to learn—and not just miserly scraps but the great truths of the universe hanging just out of reach like fruit ready to be plucked. Conversation with other resident scholars is transcendent, opening the doors of the mind. Very few ever want to leave once they arrive.": "伊莱汉卓尔非常渴望将他的教师队伍传播到更广阔的位面。他与凡人位面的一些寺庙、大学和法师学院保持着通信联系。虽然研究九幽地狱的秘密对邪恶法师和各种发光体都很有吸引力，但伊莱汉卓尔也非常希望通过吸引其他方面的法师来保持平衡。他写道：\"研究邪恶之心，以期消除其影响，这种做法很有说服力。他经常说的一句话是：\"一个人必须真正了解一件事，然后才能战胜它\"。从凡人世界来到绿洲的学者们发现这里的机遇令人目不暇接。这里总是有新的东西值得学习--而且不仅仅是吝啬的零碎知识，而是宇宙的伟大真理，就像触手可及的果实，随时可以摘下。与其他常驻学者的对话是超凡脱俗的，它打开了心灵之门。很少有人来了还想走。",

Magnificent marble pillars line the hallways, dividing them into sections, and each section stretches off until it is lost in distant shadows. There are upper levels, and these also grow faint as they rise beyond where the eye can see. Elaborate, curling staircases descend underground, suggesting further levels below, and rise upward until they vanish.

	"Now in possession of their soul, the character must escape the ice. However, the longer the characters were inside the Echo, the thicker the ice around them has grown.

It is tethered by a magical chain with a length of 1.5 metre (though given the creature's size, it is capable of reaching much further than that). Currently it is docile and apparently tolerates, if not enjoys, Malecki's grotesque surgery. If she is attacked, Malecki uses a bonus action to free it from the chain, and the creature defends her.": "马莱奇仍在制作她的最新作品，这是一个尚未命名的恶魔战争机器（使用 (%0%) 恶魔的统计数据）。它被一条长度为 1.5 米的魔法链条拴住（不过考虑到它的体型，它能拴得更远）。目前，它很温顺，显然能忍受甚至喜欢马莱克的怪异手术。如果她受到攻击，马莱克会使用一个额外动作将它从锁链中解救出来，而这个生物也会保护她。",

	"The items of value these giants crafted aren't easily transported. If an entire day is spent excavating, the characters recover a 5-kilogramm statue made of gold and gems (and worth (%0%) gp).

A similar statue can be recovered with each day's effort, until (%1%) have been unearthed.": "这些巨人制作的贵重物品不易运输。如果花上一整天的时间进行挖掘，角色们就能找到一座用黄金和宝石打造的 5 千克重的雕像（价值 (%0%) gp）。不过，除非得到男爵的特许，否则这次发掘会引起魔鬼的注意和愤怒。每努力一天，就能找回一个类似的雕像，直到出土 (%1%) 个雕像为止。",
	"If the characters pursue the modron, it tries to stay in the air 60-24 metre away from them and fires arrows. It can't be reasoned with.
