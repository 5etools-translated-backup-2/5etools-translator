Centuries ago, the outpost was conquered by mind flayers, and the goblins there were exposed to the illithids' strange powers, leading a subset of the goblins to develop unusual psionic powers.

The gemstone lets Ruxithid telepathically communicate with the mind flayers, who he believes are gods. The mind flayers demand that Ruxithid's goblins find peculiar, black stone shards that came from an ancient obelisk once erected in the wilds outside of Phandalin. The obelisk originated in the ancient Netherese empire and is said to have transformative capabilities, although the goblins know very little about its properties or history.

	"The Nematode doesn't open its mouth, and the characters can't force it open from here. The stony teeth and tough flesh are 3 metre thick at the thinnest point, so excavating an entrance is all but impossible.

	"The Nematode's mouth remains closed until the pressure of it brain fluid is released. Once the fluid is released, the Nematode opens its mouth and doesn't close it again for weeks.": "线虫的嘴一直闭着，直到脑液的压力释放出来。一旦脑液释放出来，线虫就会张开嘴巴，几个星期都不会再合拢。",
	"The membrane has AC 10; 80 hit points; and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. When the membrane is reduced to 0 hit points, it tears open with a violent shudder.

	"Controlling the fluid's release more carefully requires the following steps:": "要更小心地控制液体的释放，需要采取以下步骤：",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ((%0%)) or Intelligence ((%1%)) check realizes that destroying the membrane entirely would force the creature to open its mouth but would also trigger a dangerous physical reaction. Releasing the fluid through a small hole in the proper place causes the creature to open its mouth without triggering regurgitation.": "成功通过 DC 10 智慧（(%0%)）或智力（(%1%)）检定的角色会意识到，完全破坏薄膜会迫使生物张开嘴巴，但同时也会引发危险的生理反应。通过在适当位置开一个小孔释放液体会使生物张开嘴，但不会引发反胃。",

	"The metal tongue belongs to the Toppled Statue nodule (see below). The tongue is about 0.3 metre long and half as wide. It was inside the statue's mouth and functioned as a lever to access a secret room in the statue's base, but the mind flayer fanatics broke off the tongue to trap prisoners from Phandalin in the statue. The fanatics hid the tongue in the Occluding Miasma's fog.": "金属舌头属于 \"倒塌的雕像 \"结核（见下文）。舌头长约 0.3 米，宽约一半。它原本在雕像的口腔内，用作进入雕像底座密室的杠杆，但心灵剥离者狂热者折断了舌头，将来自范达林的囚犯困在了雕像中。狂热者们将舌头藏在了 \"闭塞瘴气 \"的迷雾中。",

	"This metal statue, once eighty feet tall, has fallen from its large, cube-shaped metal base. The statue depicts a robed mind flayer with a humanlike grin just visible beneath its facial tentacles. A faint hammering emanates from the statue's metal base.": "这座金属雕像曾经有八十英尺高，现在已经从巨大的立方体金属底座上掉了下来。雕像描绘的是一个身着长袍的心灵捕食者，在其面部触手下，可以看到一个类似人类的笑容。雕像的金属底座发出微弱的敲击声。",

	"Ablinash possessed an unusual mutation: its mouth was that of a human instead of a mind flayer. Ablinash had facial tentacles like other mind flayers, allowing it to extract brains, but it could consume brains only by messily chewing them. It loved licking brain matter off its even, white teeth. Ablinash believed the meninges was the tastiest and most significant part of the brain, which is why it dedicated itself to the nascent godlet Ilvaash.": "阿布里纳什有一个不寻常的变异：它的嘴是人类的嘴，而不是心灵剥离者的嘴。阿布利纳什的面部触手和其他心灵剥离者一样，可以提取大脑，但它只能通过混乱的咀嚼来消耗大脑。它喜欢舔舐均匀洁白的牙齿上的脑浆。阿布利纳什认为脑膜是大脑中最美味、最重要的部分，这也是它将自己献给新生小神伊尔瓦什的原因。",
	"Later, cultists erected this statue and built the metal base to support it. The only adornment on the base is a 1.2-metre-wide, humanlike grin affixed to one side to represent Ablinash's mutation. The base's grin has no face around it, just bare metal.": "后来，崇拜者们竖起了这座雕像，并建造了金属底座来支撑它。底座上唯一的装饰物是一个 1.2 米宽的人形咧嘴笑脸，贴在一侧，代表阿布里纳什的变异。底座的咧嘴周围没有任何表情，只有光秃秃的金属。",
	"The cultists constructed a secret room in the statue's base. The only way to access it was to manipulate the tongue in the statue's mouth like a lever. Doing so caused the matching grin on the base to open.": "邪教徒们在雕像底座上建造了一个密室。进入密室的唯一方法就是像操纵杠杆一样操纵雕像口中的舌头。这样一来，底座上与之相匹配的咧嘴笑就会打开。",

	"The statue's strangest feature is its humanlike mouth. The mouth is several feet across, just like the faceless mouth adorning the statue's base. Unlike the mouth on the base, the statue's mouth hangs open, just wide enough to see that it bears only the stump of a tongue inside. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ((%0%)) check realizes that the broken stump of tongue connects to some sort of lever, but the lever won't move without returning the missing tongue to its place.": "雕像最奇特的地方在于它那张像人一样的嘴。嘴巴有几英尺宽，就像雕像底座上装饰的无脸嘴巴一样。与底座上的嘴巴不同，雕像的嘴巴是张开的，张开的程度刚好可以看到里面只有一条舌头。通过 DC 15 智力（(%0%)）检查的角色会发现，断掉的残舌连接着某种杠杆，但如果不将缺失的舌头放回原处，杠杆是不会移动的。",

	"The mind flayer fanatics realized the base would make an ideal prison for their most valuable human captives.

A creature caught between the teeth that succeeds on this saving throw can decide whether to be outside the Nematode or inside its closed mouth.": "当牙齿出现和嘴巴关闭时，洞穴中的任何人都必须进行 DC 20 的灵巧蓄力。如果蓄力失败，生物会被推近喉咙 5 英尺。被夹在牙齿之间的生物如果成功完成了这次蓄力，就可以决定是在线虫的外面，还是在它紧闭的嘴巴里。",
	"The Nematode doesn't open its mouth, and the characters can't force it open from here. The stony teeth and tough flesh are 10 feet thick at the thinnest point, so excavating an entrance is all but impossible. Spells such as (%0%) and (%1%) can create an artificial exit, but the characters should quickly realize that the most obvious way out is the 10-foot-wide throat from which the intellect snares emerged.": "线虫不会张开嘴，人物也无法从这里强行张开嘴。石质的牙齿和坚硬的肉最薄处有 10 英尺厚，因此挖掘一个入口几乎是不可能的。(%0%) 和 (%1%) 等法术可以制造出一个人工出口，但角色们应该很快就会意识到，最明显的出路就是智力陷阱出现的那个 10 英尺宽的喉咙。",
	"The great creature's throat is an organic passage 10 feet in diameter. A distant pulse thrums through the floor, and contractions cause the walls to ripple.": "巨兽的喉咙是一条直径 10 英尺的有机通道。遥远的脉搏在地板上跳动，收缩导致墙壁荡漾。",
	"The throat ends at a digestion pool 30 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep. If the characters destroyed the membrane and caused the Nematode to disgorge digestive acid, the pool is only 10 feet deep. Muscular contraction keeps other exits from the digestion pool closed until the Nematode rouses from its inert state.": "喉咙的尽头是一个直径 30 英尺、深 20 英尺的消化池。如果虫体破坏了薄膜，导致线虫排出消化酸，那么消化池只有 10 英尺深。肌肉收缩使消化池的其他出口关闭，直到线虫从惰性状态中苏醒过来。",
	"The poisonous fog is a permanent (%0%) effect that's 200 feet in diameter and can't be dispersed by wind. The fog conceals a small nodule made of dirt, only 25 feet across, at its center. A smooth, flat ribbon of metal about a foot long is the only thing on the nodule. The metal is bumpy on one side and smooth on the bottom, resembling an oversized human tongue (see below). If a character casts (%1%) within 30 feet of the tongue, the tongue gives off an abjuration aura.": "毒雾是一种永久性（%0%）效果，直径为 200 英尺，无法被风吹散。毒雾的中心隐藏着一个由泥土制成的小结节，直径只有 25 英尺。结核上只有一条一英尺长的平滑金属带。金属的一面凹凸不平，底部则很光滑，就像一个特大号的人类舌头（见下文）。如果人物在舌头 30 英尺范围内施放 (%1%)，舌头就会散发出禁咒光环。",
	"The metal tongue belongs to the Toppled Statue nodule (see below). The tongue is about 1 foot long and half as wide. It was inside the statue's mouth and functioned as a lever to access a secret room in the statue's base, but the mind flayer fanatics broke off the tongue to trap prisoners from Phandalin in the statue. The fanatics hid the tongue in the Occluding Miasma's fog.": "金属舌头属于 \"倒塌的雕像 \"结核（见下文）。舌头长约 1 英尺，宽约一半。它原本在雕像的口中，用作进入雕像底座密室的杠杆，但心灵剥离者狂热者将舌头折断，将来自范达林的囚犯困在雕像中。狂热者们将舌头藏在了 \"闭塞瘴气 \"的迷雾中。",
	"Later, cultists erected this statue and built the metal base to support it. The only adornment on the base is a 4-foot-wide, humanlike grin affixed to one side to represent Ablinash's mutation. The base's grin has no face around it, just bare metal.": "后来，崇拜者们竖起了这座雕像，并建造了金属底座来支撑它。底座上唯一的装饰物是一个 4 英尺宽、像人一样的咧嘴笑脸，贴在一侧，代表阿布里纳什的变异。底座的咧嘴周围没有任何表情，只有光秃秃的金属。",
	"(%0%) +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ((%1%)) slashing damage; if the target is an Aberration, it takes an additional 6 ((%2%)) slashing damage, and if it is grappling a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or its grapple ends.": "(%0%) +10命中，攻击距离 5 英尺，一个目标。命中：19（(%1%)）刀砍伤害；如果目标是畸变体，则会受到额外 6（(%2%)）刀砍伤害，如果它正在抓取一个生物，则必须在 DC 15 力量蓄力中成功，否则抓取结束。",
	"The windmill is powered by ancient magic, not wind, and continues to turn unless its blades are wholly destroyed. Each blade has AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. As long as at least two blades are turning, they keep the smoke 30 feet from the building.": "风车的动力来自古老的魔法，而不是风，除非风车的叶片被完全摧毁，否则风车会继续转动。每片叶片的 AC 值为 13，命中点数为 30，对中毒和精神伤害免疫。只要至少有两片叶片在转动，它们就能将烟雾阻挡在距离建筑物 30 英尺的地方。",
	"(%0%) is always accompanied by a severed head, which has the statistics of an (%1%) with a speed of 10 feet. The head lacks the Encephalon Progeny ability.": "(%0%) 总是伴随着一个被砍下的头颅，它的数据与 (%1%) 相同，速度为 10 英尺。这颗头颅缺乏 \"脑后代 \"能力。",

	"(%0%) is immune to the (%1%) condition and has a flying speed of 30 feet.": "(%0%) 对 (%1%) 条件免疫，飞行速度为 30 英尺。",
	"The true scope of the danger dawns as the morning light illuminates the Nematode writhing 500 feet above the town like a malevolent cloud. The creature is far too large to defeat by conventional attacks or spells, so the characters must once again explore the Nematode from the inside, just as they did in the Endless Void.": "晨光照亮了在小镇上空 500 英尺处蠕动的线虫，就像一片邪恶的乌云，危险的真正范围也随之显现。这种生物体型庞大，常规攻击或法术都无法打败它，因此角色们必须再次从内部探索线虫，就像在无尽虚空中所做的那样。",
