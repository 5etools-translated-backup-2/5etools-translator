	"You find the answer to these questions during the game by making a (%0%) roll!": "在游戏过程中，您可以通过掷 (%0%) 来找到这些问题的答案！",
	"The 20-sided die ((%0%)) is the most-used die in D&D. It is rolled whenever a character or a creature tries to do something important.": "20 面骰（（%0%））是 D&D 中最常用的骰子。每当角色或生物试图做一些重要的事情时，就会掷出这个骰子。",
	"Things a character might try to do are listed under \"Attacks\" and \"Skills\" on the character sheets. Next to attacks and skills are number expressions, such as \"+5 to hit.\" This is the number you add to your die roll when your character uses that attack or skill.": "角色可以尝试做的事情列在角色表的 \"攻击 \"和 \"技能 \"下。攻击和技能旁边有数字表达，如 \"命中 +5\"。这是当角色使用该攻击或技能时，在掷骰子时加上的数字。",
	"For example, the character sheet for Shalefire Stoutheart lists \"Handaxe\" under \"Attacks,\" with \"+6 to hit\" next to it. If Shalefire wants to attack a monster with their handaxe, the player rolls a (%0%). If the die roll is a 10, the player adds 6 to the die roll for a final attack score of 16.": "例如，Shalefire Stoutheart 的角色表在 \"攻击 \"下列出了 \"手斧\"，旁边还有 \"命中+6\"。如果 Shalefire 想要用他们的手斧攻击怪物，玩家就掷一个 (%0%)。如果掷出的骰子是 10，玩家就在骰子上加 6，最终攻击得分为 16。",
	"How does the player know if their roll succeeds or fails? Read on to find out!": "玩家如何知道自己的掷骰子是成功还是失败？请继续阅读了解详情！",
	"The number a character tries to equal or exceed with an attack roll is called Armor Class (also called AC). The higher a creature's Armor Class, the harder that creature is to hit. In the previous example, Shalefire's attack roll with a handaxe would hit a creature with an Armor Class of 16 or lower.": "角色攻击掷卷时试图等于或超过的数字称为装甲等级（也称 AC）。生物的装甲等级越高，就越难击中。在前面的例子中，夏利菲尔使用手斧的攻击翻滚可以击中装甲等级为 16 或更低的生物。",
	"When an attack roll hits, it deals damage. The damage roll appears after the attack on the character sheet. Shalefire's handaxe does \"(%0%) damage,\" so the player would roll one 6-sided die ((%1%)) and add 4 to the die roll.": "攻击卷命中时会造成伤害。伤害卷出现在角色表的攻击之后。Shalefire 的手斧会造成\"(%0%) 伤害\"，因此玩家要掷一个 6 面骰（(%1%)），然后在骰子上加上 4。",
	"Difficulty Class (DC) is the number that a character must equal or exceed to succeed at an action that is not an attack. This includes rolls to use skills.": "难度等级（Difficulty Class，DC）是角色在非攻击行动中取得成功所必须达到或超过的数值。这包括使用技能的翻滚。",
	"For example, if Shalefire wants to move a heavy boulder blocking the mouth of a cave, that requires a skill called (%0%). Under \"Skills\" on Shalefire's character sheet, it says \"(%1%) +6,\" so Shalefire's player rolls a 20-sided die and adds 6 to the number on the die. If the Difficulty Class to move the boulder is 12, the player would need to roll a 6 or higher for Shalefire to move the boulder.": "例如，如果舍利火想移动一块堵住洞口的巨石，这需要一个名为 (%0%) 的技能。在神火的角色表中，\"技能 \"下面写着\"（%1%）+6\"，因此神火的玩家要掷一个 20 面的骰子，然后在骰子上的数字上加上 6。如果移动巨石的难度等级是 12，那么玩家需要掷出 6 或更高的骰子才能让神火移动巨石。",
	"The Difficulty Class for actions a character can attempt is given in the adventure text. In general, a Difficulty Class of 10 ((%0%)) is easy, while a DC of 15 is challenging. Most of the actions in this adventure are (%1%). The Dungeon Master can change DCs if circumstances make an action easier or harder. They can also make up their own DCs when the characters attempt actions not covered in the adventure.": "冒险文本中给出了角色可尝试的行动的难度等级。一般来说，难度等级为 10 ((%0%)) 的行动比较简单，而难度等级为 15 的行动则具有挑战性。本冒险中的大部分行动都是 (%1%)。如果情况使某个行动变得更容易或更困难，地下城主可以更改 DC。当角色尝试冒险中没有涉及的行动时，他们也可以自己设定DC。",
	"Sometimes what's happening in the adventure makes things easier for a character. At other times, the odds are stacked against the heroes. These circumstances can be reflected in D&D as \"advantage\" or \"disadvantage.\"": "有时，冒险中发生的事情会让角色更轻松。而在其他情况下，英雄们则会遇到很多不利因素。这些情况在 D&D 中可以反映为 \"优势 \"或 \"劣势\"。",
	"Advantage and disadvantage are powerful game tools. They make (%0%) rolls more likely to succeed or fail, so use them wisely. They are best used as a reward for clever play by the players, or to represent good or bad luck affecting the story. In the full version of the D&D rules, certain rules automatically give a character advantage or disadvantage. For this adventure, the DM can decide when to apply advantage or disadvantage to rolls. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out, and the roll is made normally.": "优势和劣势是强大的游戏工具。它们使（%0%）掷骰子更有可能成功或失败，因此要明智地使用它们。它们最好用作对玩家聪明游戏的奖励，或代表影响故事情节的好运或厄运。在完整版的 D&D 规则中，某些规则会自动赋予角色优势或劣势。在这次冒险中，DM 可以决定何时对翻滚应用优势或劣势。如果角色在掷骰子时既有优势又有劣势，它们会相互抵消，掷骰子会正常进行。",
	"If Shalefire attacks a monster with a handaxe while the monster is distracted by another character, the monster can't see the attack coming. The DM might decide the monster is easier to hit while distracted, so Shalefire would make the attack roll with advantage.": "如果舍利火用手斧攻击一个怪物，而怪物正被另一个角色分心，那么怪物就看不到攻击的到来。DM 可能会认为在怪物分心的时候更容易击中它，因此神火会以优势进行攻击翻滚。",
	"Advantage means that instead of rolling the (%0%) once for the attack roll, Shalefire's player rolls the (%1%) twice and uses the higher roll. They then add the normal modifier (+6 for Shalefire's handaxe) to get a final attack result.": "优势的意思是，神火的玩家在掷攻击卷时不掷一次 (%0%)，而是掷两次 (%1%)，并使用掷得较高的一次。然后，他们再加上正常的修改器（对于 Shalefire 的手斧来说是 +6），得到最终的攻击结果。",
	"Disadvantage works like advantage in reverse. If something in the game makes it harder to take an action, the roll for that action is made with disadvantage. For example, as Shalefire climbs a cliff using a rope, a monster at the top of the cliff shakes the rope. Because it's now harder to climb, Shalefire makes the (%0%) roll to climb the rope with disadvantage.": "劣势的作用与优势相反。如果游戏中的某样东西增加了行动的难度，那么掷骰子时就会出现劣势。例如，当舍利弗使用绳子攀爬悬崖时，悬崖顶上的怪物会摇动绳子。因为现在更难攀爬了，所以谷火在进行 (%0%) 翻滚以劣势攀爬绳子。",
	"Disadvantage means that instead of rolling the (%0%) once to make the (%1%) check to climb, Shalefire's player rolls the (%2%) twice and uses the lower roll. They then add the normal modifier (+6 for Shalefire's (%3%) skill) to get a final result.": "劣势意味着，神火的玩家不是掷一次 (%0%) 来进行 (%1%) 攀爬检查，而是掷两次 (%2%)，并使用掷得较低的一次。然后，他们再加上正常的修正系数（对于 Shalefire 的 (%3%) 技能，修正系数为 +6），得出最终结果。",
	"Every creature in D&D has a number of \"hit points.\" This number reflects the damage a creature can take before it falls (%0%) or is defeated. When a character or creature is damaged by an attack roll or a hazard in the game, the amount of damage dealt is subtracted from the character's or creature's hit points.": "D&D 中的每种生物都有一定数量的 \"命中点\"。这个数字反映了一个生物在倒下（%0%）或被打败之前可以承受的伤害。当角色或生物在游戏中受到攻击卷或危险的伤害时，所受的伤害会从角色或生物的命中点数中减去。",
	"If a creature reaches 0 hit points, they are defeated. The players can decide if this means a creature is dead or (%0%) or if they run away.": "如果生物的命中率为 0，它们就会被打败。玩家可以决定这是否意味着生物死亡或 (%0%)，也可以决定它们是否逃跑。",
	"When a character reaches 0 hit points, they are (%0%). In this adventure, a character at 0 hit points remains (%1%) until they regain hit points through healing or until the end of the encounter, when they regain 1 hit point automatically. The adventure details ways to regain hit points.": "当角色的命中率为 0 时，他们的命中率为 (%0%)。在这次冒险中，命中率为 0 的角色会一直保持 (%1%)，直到他们通过治疗恢复命中率或在遭遇战结束时自动恢复 1 点命中率。冒险中详细介绍了恢复命中点数的方法。",
	"A DM gets to use their imagination while presenting the adventure to the other players. The DM can add excitement to the game as they describe the situations and help players navigate their way through the action.": "在向其他玩家展示冒险的过程中，DM 可以充分发挥自己的想象力。DM 可以在描述情况和帮助玩家通过行动导航时为游戏增添刺激。",
	"This adventure is divided into \"encounters,\" which are like scenes from a movie or show. Each encounter has specific challenges. Once the players complete the challenges, move on to the next scene. The flow of the game is described below.": "这次冒险分为 \"奇遇\"，就像电影或节目中的场景。每个场景都有特定的挑战。玩家完成挑战后，进入下一个场景。游戏流程如下。",
	"A D&D session begins with the DM and the other players having a conversation. The DM explains the situation the characters are in. The players can ask questions about the situation, and the DM answers those questions to further explain what's happening.": "D&D 会话开始时，DM 和其他玩家进行对话。设计者解释角色所处的情况。玩家可以提出有关情况的问题，DM 会回答这些问题，进一步解释正在发生的事情。",
	"Then the DM asks the most important question in the DM's toolbox:": "然后，DM 问出 DM 工具箱中最重要的问题：",
	"\"What do you do?\"": "\"你是做什么的？\"",
	"At this point, players should explain what they want their characters to do. (If what they want to do is impossible, the DM says so and asks the player to choose a different action. For example, a character can't walk through a wall unless they have some special ability or magic that allows them to do so.)": "这时，玩家应该解释他们想让自己的角色做什么。(如果他们想做的事情是不可能的，那么游戏管理者就会说出来，并要求玩家选择另一种行动。例如，角色不能穿过墙壁，除非他们有某种特殊能力或魔法允许他们这样做）。",
	"If the action is possible and very easy to do, the character automatically succeeds. Opening an unlocked door or lifting a light object doesn't require heroic effort, so no (%0%) roll is necessary.": "如果该动作是可能的，而且非常容易完成，角色就会自动成功。打开一扇未上锁的门或举起一件轻便的物品并不需要付出英雄般的努力，因此不需要进行 (%0%) 翻滚。",
	"When the action is somewhere between easy and impossible, trying to do it could lead to success or failure. That's when the DM calls for a (%0%) roll. See the \"(%1%) Rolls\" section earlier in this document.": "当行动介于容易和不可能之间时，尝试去做可能会成功，也可能会失败。这就是 DM 要求进行 (%0%) 翻滚的时候。请参阅本文前面的\"（%1%）掷骰子 \"部分。",
	"The (%0%) roll, plus its modifiers, determines whether the action succeeds or fails. What does success or failure mean for an adventure? This is where you and the players get to tell a story together!": "(%0%)掷骰子的结果加上修改器，决定了行动成功还是失败。成功或失败对冒险意味着什么？这就是你和玩家一起讲故事的地方！",
	"When a (%0%) roll succeeds or fails, the DM and the players can turn that result into a part of the ongoing story. What does it look like when a monster is defeated? What does Shalefire say or do if the heavy boulder blocking the cave doesn't budge? These points in the game can spark great storytelling and acting moments.": "当（%0%）掷骰成功或失败时，管理者和玩家可以将结果转化为故事的一部分。怪物被打败时是什么样子？如果堵住洞穴的巨石纹丝不动，夏利菲尔会说什么或做什么？游戏中的这些点都能引发精彩的故事和表演时刻。",
	"Remember, though, that part of the DM's job is to keep the game's story moving forward. If describing every single attack roll in a long combat gets boring, just say how much damage the attack deals and get to the next exciting moment.": "不过请记住，DM 的部分工作就是让游戏故事继续向前发展。如果在漫长的战斗中描述每一次攻击掷骰子都会让人觉得无聊，那就直接说攻击造成了多少伤害，然后进入下一个激动人心的时刻。",
	"Here are some tips for DMs that can help them run great games:": "以下是一些给 DM 的提示，可以帮助他们运营出色的游戏：",
	"Rule 0 of D&D is simple: Have fun. It's fine if everyone agrees to change the rules as long as doing so means the game is more fun for everyone.": "D&D 规则 0 很简单： 玩得开心。如果每个人都同意更改规则也没关系，只要这样做意味着游戏对每个人来说都更有趣。",
	"The players and the DM are all on the same team. DMs aren't playing against the characters. The DM wins when the players have fun and the story is exciting and memorable.": "玩家和 DM 都在同一个团队中。管理者不是在和角色对着干。玩家玩得开心，故事精彩难忘，DM 就赢了。",
	"Allow the players to succeed as much as possible, and let them participate in the telling of the story. If they want to try something unexpected, try to say \"yes\" and then work their ideas into the story. If you have to say \"no\" to a player's idea, suggest options that let them do something similar.": "尽可能让玩家取得成功，让他们参与故事的讲述。如果他们想尝试一些意想不到的东西，尽量说 \"好\"，然后将他们的想法融入故事中。如果你不得不对玩家的想法说 \"不\"，那就提出让他们做类似事情的方案。",
	"Peril in Pinebrook is an outline for your game. Change or make up anything you need to if it makes the game more fun. The text can't cover everything players might want to do. What does a monster smell like? That's up to you, or you can ask the players what they think!": "松溪的危险》是您的游戏大纲。如果能让游戏更有趣，您可以更改或编造任何内容。文本不可能涵盖玩家想做的所有事情。怪物闻起来像什么？这取决于你，或者你可以问问玩家们的想法！",
	"While the players determine what their characters do, the DM controls all the other characters in the game. Nonplayer characters (also known as NPCs) are a great tool for the DM to help the characters understand the game and the story, and to work information into the story smoothly.": "玩家决定自己的角色做什么，而 DM 则控制游戏中的所有其他角色。非玩家角色（也称 NPC）是 DM 帮助角色了解游戏和故事情节，并将信息顺利融入故事情节的重要工具。",
	"D&D is a game of fantasy, where heroes use wits, skill, and determination to overcome obstacles. Sometimes those obstacles are defeated with weapons and spells. But characters can succeed in other ways. Communicating with monsters, tricking them or frightening them away, or avoiding a fight while cleverly sneaking past a challenge can be just as much fun. Such options are ideal if anyone playing the game wants to avoid violence.": "D&D 是一款奇幻游戏，在游戏中，英雄们运用智慧、技能和决心克服重重障碍。有时，这些障碍会被武器和咒语打败。但角色也可以通过其他方式取得成功。与怪物交流、欺骗它们或吓跑它们，或者巧妙地躲过挑战，避免战斗，这些都同样有趣。如果玩游戏的人希望避免暴力，那么这些选择就是理想的选择。",
	"Encourage your players to speak to you, publicly or privately, if something in the game upsets them. Then respond appropriately. For instance, you can move past upsetting topics by quickly narrating a resolution to a scene, then quickly move to the next part of the story.": "鼓励球员在比赛中遇到不开心的事情时，公开或私下向你倾诉。然后做出适当的回应。例如，你可以通过快速叙述一个场景的解决方法来转移令人不快的话题，然后快速进入故事的下一部分。",

The more hostile creatures of the mountains, especially the dangerous ice trolls, haven't been seen in the past two months. Yesterday, however, a patrol saw large, frosty troll footprints in the forest. Could the rumors of a friendly silver dragon be just rumors after all?

Captain Kole glances nervously at the forest trail before she nods at your group.": "危险的生物有时会在森林里游荡，但最近一直很安全。有传言说，最近有一只友好的银龙在最近的山上建立了巢穴。在过去的两个月里，山里更凶恶的生物，尤其是危险的冰巨魔，再也没有出现过。然而昨天，一支巡逻队在森林里看到了巨大的冰霜巨魔脚印。关于银龙友好的传言会不会只是谣言呢？今天带领你们巡逻的是村卫队长，艾玛珍-科勒队长。科勒队长紧张地瞥了一眼森林小径，然后向你们点头示意。",
