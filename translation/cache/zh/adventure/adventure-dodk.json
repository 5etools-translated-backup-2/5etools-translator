Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own.

They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal.

	"The personal quests have been kept open-ended so you can work with your players to deeply customize them. You should feel free to integrate unexpected twists or complications along the way, and establish strong connections to the city, events, and factions in the process. Here's a few suggestions for how these quests might proceed:": "个人任务是开放式的，因此您可以与玩家一起深入定制这些任务。您可以随意将意想不到的转折或复杂情况融入其中，并在此过程中与城市、事件和派系建立紧密联系。下面是一些关于这些任务如何进行的建议：",
	"The character's relative may be found in an area of the Deep Haze: near the Inscrutable Tower, Queen's Park, the crater, or perhaps in thrall to the Duchess or the (%0%). Unfortunately, they are indeed mad, and once found resist capture and constantly try to escape. A monstrous transformation can be reversed in three ways: using a (%1%) spell, by (%2%) performing a divine intervention, or by researching the (%3%) spell.": "角色的亲属可能会在深海迷雾的某个区域被发现：不可亵渎之塔、女王公园、火山口附近，或者可能是公爵夫人或（%0%）的崇拜者。不幸的是，它们确实疯了，一旦被发现就会抗拒捕捉，并不断试图逃跑。怪物变身可以通过三种方式逆转：使用 (%1%) 法术、(%2%) 进行神力干预或研究 (%3%) 法术。",
	"This quest ties the character strongly to a central conflict in the campaign. A fun twist is introducing a rival adventurer with an equally valid claim. Consult that section for more details. This character could even be one of the children of Ulrich IV.": "这个任务将角色与活动中的核心冲突紧密联系在一起。一个有趣的转折是引入一个拥有同样正当要求的对手冒险者。详情请参考该部分。这个角色甚至可以是乌尔里希四世的子女之一。",
	"This character will need to seek out the means to survive the most contaminated area in the city. Once they reach the heart of the crater, the character has another apocalyptic vision when they touch the Delerium Heart. The character must now decide what they will do to save the world.": "该角色需要在城市中污染最严重的区域寻找生存之道。到达陨石坑中心后，当角色触摸到 \"Delerium 之心 \"时，他们会看到另一个世界末日的景象。角色现在必须决定如何拯救世界。",
	"Advancement in a faction requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction. Achieving this quest happens when a faction's leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant, and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between the characters!": "在一个派别中晋升需要角色全力以赴，与其他派别无关。当一个派系的领袖将角色视为有能力且值得信赖的知己，并任命他们为自己的得力副手时，就可以完成这项任务。这项任务最具挑战性的地方在于它可能会与其他玩家角色产生利益冲突，但请将这种冲突作为角色之间的症结所在！",
	"This is a very difficult personal quest, but a straightforward one. The faction leaders are all well-protected and formidable in their own right, though (%0%) and (%1%) are significantly easier to encounter in person. Characters targeting the (%2%) or (%3%) are in for a vexing challenge!": "这是一个非常困难的个人任务，但也是一个简单的任务。虽然 (%0%) 和 (%1%) 比较容易遇到，但派系首领都有很好的保护，他们本身也很强大。以 (%2%) 或 (%3%) 为目标的角色将面临严峻的挑战！",
	"These spells can be learned from (%0%), the (%1%), Ryan Greymere and spellbooks contained within the Inscrutable Tower; the character must seek knowledge from each.

Characters can complete this quest by researching the (%2%) spell.": "这些法术可以从 (%0%)、(%1%)、莱恩-格雷梅尔和不可亵渎之塔中的法术书中学到；角色必须从每一本法术书中寻找知识。收集这些法术会引起紫水晶学院的愤怒，他们希望将这些魔法知识保密。角色可以通过研究 (%2%) 法术来完成此任务。",
	"After visiting each location, the character can research the (%0%), (%1%), and (%2%) spells respectively, even if they haven't met the other prerequisites to research these spells.": "访问每个地点后，角色可以分别研究 (%0%)、(%1%) 和 (%2%) 法术，即使他们还没有满足研究这些法术的其他先决条件。",
	"Captive or convert, the relative is found at a faction stronghold. They could even be one of the faction lieutenants! It is difficult to convince them to leave; they have to see the faction do something horrible with their own eyes.": "无论是俘虏还是皈依者，他们的亲属都是在派别据点找到的。他们甚至可能是派别中尉之一！很难说服他们离开；他们必须亲眼看到派别做出可怕的事情。",
	"Rival adventurers, a Queen's Men strike team, or an assassin might be pursuing a bounty on the character. You may want to have the Queen of Thieves or the Amethyst Academy \"acquire\" the character's debt and use that as leverage over them!": "敌对的冒险者、女王手下的突击队或刺客可能会悬赏通缉该角色。您可能想让盗贼女王或紫水晶学院 \"收购 \"角色的债务，并以此作为压制他们的筹码！",
	"Any rare magic item is an appropriate heirloom, and you can choose any location in the city where the item is lost, although Reed Manor, the Kleinberg Estate, and Slaughterstone Square are good possibilities. If you'd really like to create complications, this item could be stolen by the Queen of Thieves or a rival adventurer, or could even be one of the Seals of Drakkenheim.": "任何稀有的魔法物品都是合适的传家宝，您可以选择城市中丢失物品的任何地点，不过里德庄园、克莱恩伯格庄园和屠戮石广场都是不错的选择。如果你真的想制造麻烦，这件物品可以被盗贼女王或敌对的冒险者偷走，甚至可以是德拉肯海姆的封印之一。",
	"The ritual the character wishes to perform at each location need not be simple. Instead, it might be a time-consuming process that requires a rare offering and takes several hours to complete, or perhaps can only be performed at a certain time of day (either dawn or dusk). As such, the character will need the protection and support of their allies to stay safe during the rite.": "角色希望在每个地点举行的仪式不一定很简单。相反，它可能是一个耗时的过程，需要稀有的祭品，需要几个小时才能完成，或者可能只能在一天中的某个时间（黎明或黄昏）进行。因此，角色需要盟友的保护和支持，才能在仪式中保持安全。",
	"Suitable foes might include the (%0%), the (%1%), the Duchess, the (%2%), the Prince of Carnage, a (%3%), or a (%4%).": "合适的敌人可能包括 (%0%)、(%1%)、公爵夫人、(%2%)、大屠杀王子、(%3%) 或 (%4%)。",

	"At your option, once a character completes their personal quest, you might work with the player to create a follow-up personal quest for them to reflect the character's ongoing and evolving story. Furthermore, if conditions emerge where a character either can't complete or decides to abandon their personal quest, you should work with the player to develop a new one.": "根据你的选择，一旦某个角色完成了他们的个人任务，你可以和玩家一起为他们创建一个后续的个人任务，以反映该角色正在进行和发展的故事。此外，如果出现角色无法完成或决定放弃其个人任务的情况，你应该与玩家合作开发一个新的任务。",
	"When designing a custom personal quest, keep the following principles in mind:": "在设计定制个人任务时，请牢记以下原则：",
	"The quest should require characters to explore one or more locations within the Inner City ruins. A character shouldn't be able to complete their personal quest too early. Conversely, a personal quest involving Castle Drakken likely can't be completed until late in the campaign.": "任务应该要求角色探索内城废墟中的一个或多个地点。角色不应该过早完成个人任务。相反，涉及德拉肯城堡的个人任务可能要到战役后期才能完成。",
	"It should present some sort of complication with one of the factions, or perhaps require the characters to seek help from the faction to complete their quest.": "它应该与某个派别产生某种复杂的关系，或者要求角色寻求该派别的帮助以完成任务。",
	"The quest should be specific and achievable, and not related to character advancement (such as reaching 10th level or taking a specific feat).": "任务应具体、可实现，且与角色的提升无关（如达到 10 级或获得特定特技）。",
	"Be careful about using a \"ticking clock\" for a personal quest. While this can introduce a compelling complication, focus on long-term goals rather than extremely urgent matters.": "谨慎使用 \"滴答作响的时钟 \"作为个人追求。虽然这会带来令人信服的复杂性，但应把重点放在长期目标上，而不是极其紧迫的事情上。",
	"Players often suggest personal quests involving missing persons, lost objects, or revenge. Many example personal quests provided already cover such motivations, such as \"A Family Matter'', \"A Lost Heirloom\", and \"A Score to Settle\". Ask players to consider these options first. Perhaps their idea can be easily adapted to work with one of these quests (or vice versa).": "玩家经常会提出涉及失踪人员、遗失物品或复仇的个人任务。所提供的许多个人任务示例已经涵盖了此类动机，例如 \"家庭事务\"、\"失落的传家宝 \"和 \"算账\"。请玩家先考虑这些选项。也许他们的想法可以很容易地与这些任务之一结合起来（反之亦然）。",
	"Five factions are struggling to control the ruins of Drakkenheim: the (%0%), the (%1%), the (%2%), the (%3%), and the (%4%). Each is commanded by a prominent faction leader, but the faction as a whole behaves like a major recurring NPC, except they are composed of many individuals working together who share the same ideology, goals, methods, and resources. (%5%) describes the background, objectives, roleplaying traits, major NPCs, and assets of each faction. Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.": "有五个派系在争夺德拉肯海姆废墟的控制权： (%0%)、(%1%)、(%2%)、(%3%) 和 (%4%)。每个派系都由一位杰出的派系领袖指挥，但派系作为一个整体的行为就像一个主要的经常出现的 NPC，只不过他们是由许多人组成的，他们一起工作，有着相同的意识形态、目标、方法和资源。(%5%）描述了每个派系的背景、目标、角色扮演特征、主要 NPC 和资产。根据这些信息，您可以决定这些派系在玩家角色在德拉肯海姆的冒险中会如何帮助或阻碍他们。",
	"Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character's choices, but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.": "玩家角色要想揭开德拉肯海姆最伟大的宝藏和秘密，就必须在阴谋、谈判、破坏和暴力冲突的纷乱网络中游刃有余，而不是将各派团结起来，共同对抗一个共同的敌人。他们与每个派系的关系会随着角色的选择而自然发展，但最终还是要由他们自己来决定加入谁，反对谁。因此，每个派系都可能成为支持者、激烈的竞争者、亲密的盟友、死敌，或介于两者之间的任何一方。",
	"Exploring the most dangerous locations in Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or inciting the ire) of one or more factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.": "如果不能获得一个或多个派系的支持（或激怒他们），探索德拉肯海姆最危险的地点就会异常困难。相应地，这些派系需要玩家角色的帮助来完成他们自己在城市中的目标，并为他们的盟友提供奖励，为玩家角色的个人任务提供帮助。反之，如果派系成为敌对势力，当他们利用自己的资源对抗玩家角色时，就会在整个战役中产生动态问题和新的复杂情况。无论哪种方式，派系最好以被动的方式进行。当角色试图谈判时，他们的领导者会提出坚定的要求；当角色挫败他们的计划时，他们会策划反击；当角色反对他们的目标时，他们会进行破坏。",
	"Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to keep each faction in play as long as possible. Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them. Embrace their creativity by responding with new challenges, and rewarding players when they succeed by having their allies recognize their accomplishments. The factions are equipped with the tools to help you escalate tension and raise the stakes of the conflict in interesting ways.": "最终，这些互动可能会演变成派系之间的全面敌对。一旦出现这种情况，应尽可能让每个派别都参与游戏。如果玩家与不止一个派系为敌，也不要害怕让他们陷入困境。玩家会找到令人惊讶的方法来挫败派系，并在与派系合作时制定出狡猾的计划。通过应对新的挑战来激发他们的创造力，并在玩家取得成功时让他们的盟友认可他们的成就，以示奖励。各派系都配备了各种工具，可以帮助您以有趣的方式升级紧张局势并提高冲突的利害关系。",
	"Many adventure sites provide hooks and missions connected to the factions you may use to prompt the characters to visit each area. Each location also details how the factions could respond to possible events and outcomes that may occur.": "许多冒险网站都提供了与派系相关的钩子和任务，你可以用它们来促使角色访问每个地区。每个地点还详细介绍了各派系如何应对可能发生的事件和结果。",

	"Despite their conflicts, the faction leaders know they can't achieve their goals on their own. Not only do they seek the aid of the player characters, many factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.": "尽管存在冲突，但派系领袖们知道单靠自己的力量无法实现目标。他们不仅寻求玩家角色的帮助，许多派系还看到了相互合作的好处。外交角色可以在两个（或更多）派系之间协商结盟、休战或停火。说服任何两个派别搁置分歧、携手合作应该是困难的，但也是可以实现的。为了促成这样的交易，角色需要证明结盟将如何帮助两个派别实现其目标，同时也要对派别及其领导人的角色扮演特征、理想、纽带和缺点提出要求。这些紧张的谈判会成为战役中最令人难忘的时刻，因此最好将潜在的联盟安排在戏剧性的地点，如派别据点和圣维特鲁维奥大教堂。",
	"The factions have been designed such that a long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a short-term truce involving three is difficult but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don't always act in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will inevitably collapse.": "派系的设计使得任何两个派系之间的长期联盟都是可以实现的，而涉及三个派系的短期停战虽然困难，但也是完全可能的。在您的战役中，可能会出现无数种情况，导致各派系重新评估他们的优先事项，聪明而有说服力的玩家可能会提出令人信服的论据。当然，请记住，派系是由人组成的：而人的行为并不总是合乎逻辑的。然而，这些联盟总是不稳定的，因为每个派别都力图优先实现自己的目标。除非玩家角色不断努力维持联盟，否则任何派系之间的联盟都将不可避免地瓦解。",
	"Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Queen's Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to manipulate the player characters and the other factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical moment. Especially cunning characters might help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal betrayal against an unsuspecting ally which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.": "紫水晶学院和女王的门徒等派系甚至会利用结盟的便利机会操纵玩家角色和其他派系，甚至可能在关键时刻做出戏剧性的逆转。特别狡猾的角色可能会帮助派系编织这样的骗局和阴谋，导致毫无戒心的盟友惨遭背叛，从而让派系完全控制了德拉克肯海姆。",
	"Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may compromise the trust they earn with an individual faction. They won't receive the greatest boons the faction can offer, and faction agents don't trust characters with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of double-agents, and would much rather see the player characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player characters should constantly be called upon to demonstrate their loyalty.": "由于背叛的威胁是如此真实，在多个派系之间建立联盟的玩家角色可能会损害他们在单个派系中赢得的信任。他们不会得到派系所能提供的最大恩惠，而派系代理人也不会信任拥有敏感信息的角色。派系首领对双重代理非常警惕，他们更希望看到玩家角色对他们做出承诺。因此，玩家角色应不断被要求展示他们的忠诚。",
	"Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor's origins will not unite the factions. Instead, these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups since they deeply disagree on the best way to address the problem. Given that The Haze threatens to overtake the entire world, it may at first appear the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed. Throughout the campaign however, the feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt. You should strive to contrast this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy which insists arcane means may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic prophecies of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival factions should present a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any \"correct\" answer: It's up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to act.": "对玩家角色来说，不幸的是，发现谵妄的全部特性和流星起源的事实并不能让各派团结起来。相反，这些启示将进一步加深各派之间的分歧，因为他们在解决问题的最佳方法上存在严重分歧。鉴于 \"阴霾 \"有可能笼罩整个世界，银色骑士团必须摧毁这些水晶的观点乍看起来似乎完全正确。但是，在整个战役中，完成这一任务的可行性应该不断受到质疑。您应该努力将这一观点与紫水晶学院的理性但值得怀疑的立场形成对比，后者坚持认为奥术手段可以利用谵妄来防止进一步的灾难，而落火追随者则热衷于世界末日的预言。 每当玩家们似乎已经下定决心时，敌对派别就应该让玩家们有一种咬牙切齿的感觉，即可能还有其他选择。你应该避免提出任何 \"正确 \"的答案： 这取决于角色如何拼凑这一切，得出自己的结论，并决定如何行动。",
	"As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is inevitable, who exactly is present for that battle and the outcomes that may arise are unforeseeable.

	"When creating your own adventuring party, use pre-generated stat blocks from the Core Rules rather than spending time making character sheets for these NPCs like you would a player character. When it comes to making a good rival, interesting roleplaying traits are far more important than game statistics. A rival works well when they reflect the personalities and flaws of the player characters themselves, then exaggerate their best and worst qualities to the extreme while sharing some common ground. Diametrically opposing those traits tends to result in antagonists, not rivals. Flesh out such characters by pulling in one or two roleplaying traits from one of the backgrounds or personal quests presented in this book.": "在创建自己的冒险队伍时，请使用核心规则中预先生成的状态块，而不是像创建玩家角色那样花时间为这些 NPC 制作角色表。说到如何打造一个好对手，有趣的角色扮演特征远比游戏数据更重要。如果对手能反映玩家角色本身的个性和缺点，然后将他们最好和最坏的品质夸大到极致，同时又有一些共同点，那么他们就能很好地发挥作用。与这些特质截然相反的角色往往是对立面，而不是对手。通过从本书介绍的背景或个人任务中提取一两个角色扮演特征，来充实这些角色。",

	"Drakkenheim was a grandiose capital city famous for its many architectural wonders. The even-handed rule of House von Kessel fostered a vibrant and industrious spirit that welcomed folk throughout the realm and beyond, and the city was an international hub for trade and culture. Nearly a hundred thousand people called Drakkenheim home, and thousands more lived in small villages and hamlets a few days travel from the city. Only a few hundred people survived the cataclysm that devastated the city, and the folk who lived in the surrounding countryside have abandoned the area for safer regions.": "德拉肯海姆是一座宏伟的都城，以众多建筑奇迹而闻名。冯-凯赛尔家族不偏不倚的统治孕育了一种充满活力和勤劳的精神，它欢迎王国内外的人们，这座城市是一个国际性的贸易和文化中心。将近十万人以德拉克肯海姆为家，还有数千人居住在距离城市几天路程的小村庄里。在摧毁这座城市的大灾难中，只有几百人幸存下来，而居住在周围乡村的人们也放弃了这里，前往更安全的地区。",

Each passes through a correspondingly-named gate, and ranges from twenty to forty feet wide with broad sidewalks along either side. Wrought-iron lamp posts and sewer drains are placed throughout. They converge at Market Square. Elsewhere in the city, the common cobblestone-paved roads are twelve to eighteen feet wide. Most have a narrow two-foot wide brick sidewalk.

Wealthier homes even feature indoor plumbing directly connected to the city's water system. Dozens of smaller chapel domes and spires mark distinct boroughs in the city.

	"The Drakkenheim sewers were a sophisticated engineering marvel.

Several chimneys rise up from the slate-shingle rooftop, a light trail of smoke billowing from each. A collapsed small outbuilding, perhaps once a stable or shed, borders the yard. Sweeping around the estate grounds, there are two doors leading into the manor from the back. Both have been nailed shut with rotting planks.": "里德庄园是一座破旧的两层石屋，周围是生锈的铁栅栏和长满灌木和荆棘的杂草丛生的院子。细长的窗户从外面看都用木板封住了，但一楼却有灯光闪烁。几根烟囱从石板瓦屋顶升起，每根烟囱都冒着淡淡的烟雾。院子边上有一座倒塌的小楼，也许曾经是马厩或棚屋。扫视庄园四周，有两扇门从后面通向庄园。两扇门都用腐朽的木板钉死。",
	"A short cobblestone pathway leads through the yard up to a small set of steps leading to the central double doors. A large, round iron knocker hangs on each. Before the doors is a fountain. The central decorative statue has crumbled away into the basin, which is filled with brackish rainwater and algae. A singular obese toad basks beside the water, croaking loudly.": "一条短短的鹅卵石小路穿过院子，拾级而上，就到了中央的双扇大门。每扇门上都挂着一个圆形的大铁制门环。门前是一个喷泉。中央的装饰雕像已经坍塌，掉进了水池里，里面充满了咸咸的雨水和藻类。一只肥胖的蟾蜍在水边晒太阳，大声地呱呱叫着。",

	"What was once a sitting room is now a makeshift alchemist's workshop. Furniture draped in dust-covered cloth has been pushed aside to make space for two crowded tables set with alembics, burners, distillers, and other equipment for brewing potions. A bubbling cauldron hangs in the fireplace. Strings of herbs dangle from the ceiling, and jars of ingredients are scattered about the shelves alongside racks of empty or half-filled vials. An acrid scent fills the room.": "曾经的起居室现在成了炼金术士的临时工作室。布满灰尘的家具被推到一边，腾出空间摆放着两张拥挤的桌子，桌子上摆放着炖锅、燃烧器、蒸馏器和其他酿造药剂的设备。壁炉里挂着一个冒着气泡的大锅。一串串草药从天花板垂下，配料罐散落在架子上，旁边还有一架空的或装了一半的药瓶。房间里弥漫着一股刺鼻的气味。",

This rogue projectile tore open the ground and levelled many buildings as it skid across the city, only narrowly missing the Spokes Smithy.": "城墙以南是一个被称为 \"辐条 \"的工业区。该地区在流星雨中遭到严重破坏，一条巨大的沟壑穿过该区。这条崎岖的沟壑被称为 \"伤疤\"，是由最初流星撞击时喷射出的一块巨石造成的，这块巨石与城墙相撞后向南弹射。这颗流弹在城市中滑行时撕开了地面，夷平了许多建筑，只差一点就击中了斯波克史密斯。",
	"This once-humble smithy has been transformed into a fortified mining camp by an intrepid and entrepreneurial family of dwarven prospectors. The four Ironhelm siblings arrived in Drakkenheim a few months ago, and used their wondrous mechanical weaponry to lay claim to the rich deposits of delerium found within the Scar. While this has made them one of the most successful delerium extraction teams in Drakkenheim, they've made a loose agreement with the Queen of Thieves for protection, and now find themselves caught in the crosshairs of all five factions.": "这个曾经简陋的铁匠铺已经被一个无畏而富有企业家精神的矮人勘探者家族改造成了一个坚固的采矿营地。几个月前，铁盔四兄妹来到德拉克肯海姆，用他们神奇的机械武器开采出了疤痕中丰富的谵妄矿藏。虽然这让他们成为了德拉肯海姆最成功的谵妄提取团队之一，但他们却与盗贼女王达成了松散的保护协议，现在发现自己陷入了五大派系的夹击之中。",
	"In this adventure, one or more of the factions dispatch the player characters to deal with the Ironhelm dwarves. Each faction has different goals here, so the party may be asked to drive off the dwarves or negotiate with them.

	"When the Ironhelms arrived in Drakkenheim, they immediately clashed with the bandit gangs who had previously been picking over the delerium in the Scar. After wresting control of the claim, they cut a deal with the Queen of Thieves: the dwarves could mine the Scar unmolested, so long as they paid fifteen percent of their profits to the Queen of Thieves each week for \"protection\". However, the Ironhelms have since acquired new weaponry, and no longer feel they need to pay such a large cut for protection that has never actually materialised. The Queen of Thieves is furious, and charges the characters with stealing, sabotaging, or destroying the dwarves' gunpowder weapons to make sure they'll have to depend on her services. However, she doesn't want the dwarves' mining operations otherwise disturbed. Cracking a few skulls and roughing them up is fine, but if multiple dwarves are killed, the characters won't be rewarded.": "铁盔人抵达德拉肯海姆后，立即与之前在 \"疤痕 \"开采谵妄矿的强盗团伙发生了冲突。在夺取了采矿权之后，他们与盗贼女王达成了协议：只要矮人每周向盗贼女王支付利润的百分之十五作为 \"保护费\"，他们就可以在无人打扰的情况下开采 \"疤痕\"。然而，铁盔人后来获得了新的武器，不再觉得需要为从未真正实现的保护支付如此高昂的费用。盗贼女王勃然大怒，责令角色们偷窃、破坏或摧毁矮人的火药武器，以确保他们不得不依赖她的服务。不过，她不希望矮人的采矿活动受到其他干扰。敲碎几个骷髅头和粗暴对待他们是可以的，但如果多个矮人被杀，角色将不会得到奖励。",

He charges the characters to convince the Ironhelms to abandon Drakkenheim.

Worse, the dwarves have killed several Falling Fire pilgrims who came to the Scar seeking delerium, as the devotees stubbornly refused to back down when threatened by the Ironhelms. Unfortunately, the dwarven guns are simply too much for their pilgrims to overcome on their own, and so the Followers of the Falling Fire need the player characters to be their instrument of wrath.": "坠落之火的追随者们对矮人的带状矿井感到震惊，并希望完全停止开采。疤痕中的谵妄必须被用于神圣的目的。更糟糕的是，矮人已经杀死了几位来疤痕寻找谵妄的落火朝圣者，因为这些信徒在受到铁赫尔姆斯的威胁时顽固地拒绝退缩。不幸的是，矮人的枪炮根本无法让朝圣者们独自战胜，因此落火追随者们需要玩家角色成为他们的愤怒工具。",

Once every passenger has paid their fare, the Ferryman takes them across the water. He only transports characters to the opposite side of the river, and cannot be commanded to do anything else. He growls if someone else tries to take the oars from him, and only fights to defend himself or protect his boat.": "每当人物来到德拉肯海姆西南郊河的两岸时，摆渡人都会莫名其妙地划到水边。如果人物靠近他，摆渡人就会咕哝一声，向他的小船做个手势，然后伸出手。他要等到每个上船的人都给他类似金币的东西。一旦每个乘客都付了船费，摆渡人就会把他们带到对岸。他只能将人物送到河对岸，不能命令他做其他事情。如果有人试图夺走他的桨，他就会咆哮，并且只会为了保护自己或保护他的船而战斗。",

Multicoloured glass lenses superimposed over the planet depict the metaphysical orbit of the afterworlds and side-realms and their relation to the mortal world. The rest of the tower is decorated with elegant carved statues depicting angels, saints, demons, devils, elementals, and the various creatures of the worlds beyond. On some levels are rows of gothic windows with trefoil arches filled with stained-glass mosaics.": "中央时钟的边框是一个压花金属和玻璃表盘，上面描绘了每个月的太阳运行和月相。从这个表盘上，人们不仅可以读出时间，还可以读出日期，因为它以风格化的方式诠释了季节和星座。从钟面向下延伸，是一个由圆形玻璃板、齿轮和轮子组成的系统，以机械的精度展示了行星和恒星在星空中飞驰时的宏伟宇宙舞姿。叠加在行星上的多色玻璃透镜描绘了后世界和边界的形而上学轨道，以及它们与凡人世界的关系。塔的其他部分装饰着优雅的雕像，描绘了天使、圣人、恶魔、魔鬼、元素和其他世界的各种生物。有些楼层还有一排哥特式窗户，三叶形拱门上镶满了彩色玻璃马赛克。",

	"On the ground level, a set of stone stairs leads to the copper double doors.": "在地面层，有一组石阶通向铜质双开门。",
	"The tower interior is a dramatic contrast to the elegant outer facade. The walls are exposed brick, and a rickety wooden staircase ascends the interior supported by a wrought-iron scaffold. The decorative exterior windows allow some light to pass into the tower; many along the way are shattered and broken. The stone floor is covered in dust, bone, debris, and avian feces. Gears connected by chains, stacks of heavy dangling counterweights on pulleys, and pendulum mechanisms hang down the northern wall. High above can be seen the bells.": "塔楼内部与优雅的外墙形成鲜明对比。墙壁是裸露的砖砌成，一条摇摇晃晃的木质楼梯从铁制脚手架支撑着的墙壁通向塔内。装饰性的外窗可以透进一些光线，但沿途的许多窗户都已破碎不堪。石头地板上满是灰尘、骨头、碎片和鸟类的粪便。用链条连接的齿轮、滑轮上成堆沉重的悬挂配重以及钟摆装置垂挂在北墙上。高处可以看到大钟。",

	"The staircase ends at a wooden gantry clinging to the outer walls of the tower. This narrow walkway overlooks thirteen massive bronze bells hung in the middle of the tower belfry. Each ranges from three to five feet wide and weighs several tonnes. The bells are yoked to steel girders and do not swing. Instead, the bells are struck by exterior hammers fitted to each and controlled by the machinery above. As each bell sounds in a distinct tone, this mechanical system could play many unique bellsongs when the clock tower still functioned.": "楼梯的尽头是依附在塔外墙的木制龙门架。在这条狭窄的通道上，可以俯瞰塔钟楼中央悬挂的十三口巨大铜钟。每个铜钟宽三到五英尺，重达数吨。铜钟与钢梁相连，不会摆动。相反，钟是由安装在每个钟上的外部锤子敲击的，并由上面的机器控制。由于每个钟都发出不同的音调，当钟楼仍在运转时，这个机械系统可以演奏出许多独特的钟声。",

The floor features several steel grates and wooden hatches that allow access to the machinery and bells below. A strange granite obelisk is set in place of the main clock pendulum; the core of the \"ticking\" mechanism that controls the clock. Three empty sockets lined with delicate copper tracery are cut into the stone. A fine elven script inlaid with thin lines of silver and gold are etched into the surrounding surface. Several pennies are precisely balanced atop it. A system of pulleys, winches, and levers connects it to the rest of the clockwork.": "由齿轮、配重和钟表组成的复杂装置在这个房间里占据了主导地位。几扇薄薄的窗户可以俯瞰周围的城市景观。地板上有几个钢格栅和木制舱口，可以通向下面的机器和钟。一个奇怪的花岗岩方尖碑被放置在主钟摆的位置，它是控制时钟的 \"滴答 \"装置的核心。石头上凿有三个空槽，里面镶嵌着精致的铜饰。周围的表面还刻有镶嵌着金银细线的精美精灵文字。几枚硬币精确地平衡在上面。一个由滑轮、绞盘和杠杆组成的系统将它与其他钟表连接起来。",

	"Taking the clocktower is a major campaign milestone, and the other factions are jealous of the accomplishment.

Such action would grossly overstep the Edicts of Lumen, but Greymere flippantly replied that the realms and clergy were in no place to actually enforce the Edicts anymore.

Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates.\"": "\"魔法吸引更多魔法。在极其罕见的情况下，魔法能量会结晶成谵妄石。魔法石慢慢地从遥远的位面、可能的现实和另一个维度吸引更多的原始魔法进入这个世界。这种速度是指数级的。在大量的谵妄周围会出现更多的泄漏。这些混乱的能量本质上具有不稳定性。不集中的魔法会随意产生矛盾的不可能性，留下挥之不去的长老污染。如果不加以控制，这些魔法力量就会表现为阴霾。更多的谵妄在其中形成，从而加速了这一过程。\"",

	"\"Delerium presents an existential danger, but also opportunity. The concentration of delerium in Drakkenheim could provide an infinite supply of magical energy if directly harnessed, rather than simply crafting items individually. I've found promising results so far at collecting the energy given off by the stones - the problem is storage and containment. The abjurations required are just outside my wheelhouse. If it could be accomplished at-scale, not only would it be possible to fuel endless magical creations, it might actually slow the growth of the Haze, even hold it at equilibrium.\"": "\"Delerium 带来了生存危险，但也带来了机遇。如果直接利用德拉肯海姆的谵妄石浓度，而不是简单地单独制作物品，就能提供无穷无尽的魔法能量。到目前为止，我已经在收集宝石释放的能量方面取得了可喜的成果，问题在于储存和控制。所需的咒语超出了我的能力范围。如果能大规模实现，不仅可以为无穷无尽的魔法创造提供燃料，还可能减缓阴霾的增长，甚至将其保持在平衡状态。",

The structure dominates the plaza, completely dwarfing the nearby buildings with a two-hundred-fifty-foot-tall spired central dome that looms large over the gently sloping terracotta rooftops of the surrounding townhouses. The main dome is flanked by four stocky towers meticulously decorated with religious iconography and angelic sculptures. Between each are semicircular apses lined with stained glass windows fifty feet high, thus the building has a roughly square footprint. The outer facade has rows of alcoves containing life-size statues of valiant paladins and devoted clerics. Broad steps lead up to the columned entrance portico where a massive rose window rests above three sets of golden double doors embossed with heavenly visages.": "在这个庄严的广场上，宽阔的鹅卵石街道环绕着一座巨大的巴洛克式大教堂。这座建筑在广场上占据着主导地位，两百五十英尺高的尖顶中央穹顶让附近的建筑相形见绌，在周围联排别墅缓缓倾斜的赤陶屋顶上若隐若现。主穹顶两侧有四座粗壮的塔楼，塔楼上精心装饰着宗教圣像和天使雕塑。每座塔楼之间都有一个半圆形的天井，天井两侧是 50 英尺高的彩色玻璃窗，因此建筑的占地面积大致为正方形。外立面有一排凹室，里面有与真人大小相同的英勇的圣骑士和虔诚的教士雕像。宽阔的台阶通向入口处的圆柱门廊，那里有一扇巨大的玫瑰窗，上面是三扇金色的双扇门，门上浮雕着天堂的肖像。",
	"Splayed out before the majestic building is a sprawling and ramshackle camp of makeshift hovels, smoking pyres, and improvised barricades. Tall wooden stakes are driven into the ground along the streets, displaying macabre trophies of bones, ribcages, skulls, and body parts.

Smaller pockets of delerium continue to emerge, however, necessitating constant cleanup efforts. The Silver Order staunchly maintains control over the city until the work is done, though other factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Followers of the Falling Fire will almost certainly continue opposing their efforts. Once every trace of contamination is eradicated, people may return to Drakkenheim to rebuild.

New converts flow into Drakkenheim to take the sacrament - first hundreds, then thousands, then more.

The faithful stay the course as the world slowly descends into chaos over several decades. Sanctified devotees may survive within the Haze, but monsters grow great and terrible as the whole earth is swallowed by the mists. Even mighty Argonath eventually falls. When the world begins shaking apart, the final Follower of the Falling Fire completes the sacrament before a vast assemblage of golden delerium crystals containing millions of righteous souls. In that moment, Lucretia Mathias' prophecies might come to pass, or they might not. Either way, the world undergoes a new apotheosis in a brilliant corona of multicoloured light.": "坠落之火的追随者们没有采取任何措施阻止新的谵妄形成，因此阴霾有增无减。数十年来，信徒们坚持不懈，世界慢慢陷入混乱。虔诚的信徒可以在雾霾中生存，但随着整个大地被迷雾吞噬，怪物也变得越来越多、越来越可怕。就连强大的阿尔戈纳斯最终也倒下了。当世界开始摇摇欲坠时，最后一位陨火追随者在一大片金色的谵妄水晶前完成了圣礼，这些水晶中蕴含着数百万个正义的灵魂。在那一刻，露迪雅-马蒂亚斯的预言可能会实现，也可能不会。无论如何，世界都会在绚丽的五彩光晕中经历一次新的神化。",

They won't carry out this plan without support from a new monarch of Drakkenheim, or at least with sufficient backing from whatever authority remains in Westemär.

Once all the delerium is quarried, the Amethyst Academy claims they will lower the barrier and help rebuild the city.": "对紫晶学院来说，如此引人注目地展示魔法力量是一个重大的政治风险。如果没有德拉肯海姆新任君主的支持，或者至少没有威斯特迈尔残存的权力机构的足够支持，他们是不会实施这个计划的。大法师们声称，这道屏障是最终恢复德拉肯海姆的最大希望：它可以让紫水晶学院小心翼翼地开采出 delerium，这样他们就可以把这些 delerium 用来建造魔法物品，他们会很乐意把这些物品卖给任何买得起的人。一旦开采出所有的谵妄石，紫水晶学院声称他们将放下屏障，帮助重建城市。",

	"Naturally of course, the player characters are called upon to enact these plans and participate in casting the spell, which might prompt a last-ditch sabotage attempt from an enemy faction. Once cast, the spell is indeed powerful enough to halt expansion of the Haze, effectively turning Drakkenheim into a greenhouse where the Amethyst Academy may harvest and study delerium at their sole discretion. Thereafter, only Academy mages and their designated allies are permitted through the barrier. A few scavengers and looters find secret tunnels and hidden means of entry, and occasionally, monsters escape via the river or underground passages. The city remains a dangerous place, but one largely quarantined within the colossal prismatic barrier. However, rather than strip-mine delerium, the Academy carefully cultivates it. The barrier remains indefinitely, because the Academy intentionally allows more delerium to grow within to maintain their supply. The Amethyst Academy uses its newfound wealth and influence to clandestinely reshape the political destiny of the continent, and possibly even unravel the Edicts of Lumen.": "当然，玩家角色需要执行这些计划并参与施法，这可能会促使敌方派系进行最后的破坏尝试。一旦施法，咒语的威力确实足以阻止阴霾的扩张，有效地将德拉克肯海姆变成一个温室，紫水晶学院可以在这里随意收获和研究谵妄。此后，只有学院的法师和他们指定的盟友才能通过屏障。一些拾荒者和劫掠者找到了秘密通道和隐蔽的进入方式，偶尔也会有怪物从河流或地下通道逃走。这座城市仍然是一个危险的地方，但在很大程度上被隔离在巨大的棱镜屏障之外。不过，学院并没有对谵妄进行剥离开采，而是精心培育它。由于学院有意让更多的 delerium 在屏障内生长，以保持供应，因此屏障会无限期地保持下去。 紫水晶学院利用其新发现的财富和影响力，暗中重塑大陆的政治命运，甚至有可能解开流明敕令。",
	"Nevertheless, should the prismatic barrier fall through sabotage or negligence, the results would be appropriately catastrophic. The feedback force shatters the Inscrutable Tower and causes the Haze to violently explode outward for hundreds of miles around. The volatile magic greatly accelerates the expansion of the Haze, and the world is destroyed only a few years later.": "然而，如果棱镜屏障因破坏或疏忽而掉落，结果将是灾难性的。反馈力击碎了不可亵渎之塔，并导致周围数百英里范围内的阴霾剧烈向外爆炸。挥发的魔力大大加速了阴霾的扩张，仅仅几年后，世界就毁灭了。",
	"In the midst of ongoing conflict, it's possible none rule the ruins save monsters and mayhem. Perhaps several of the plans above fail, no credible heir survives, and the player characters and factions decide that Drakkenheim is best abandoned. A new ruler might decide to establish another city as the capital of Westemär. Unless they possess both political savvy and military strength, Westemär will likely fragment into several smaller realms as a result. Indeed, this is the most likely course unless the player characters intervene, though one that unfolds over decades of intrigue, betrayal, and war.": "在持续不断的冲突中，除了怪物和混乱之外，可能没有人能够统治废墟。也许上述几个计划都失败了，没有可靠的继承人存活下来，玩家角色和派系决定最好放弃德拉克肯海姆。新的统治者可能会决定建立另一座城市作为威斯特迈尔的首都。除非他们同时拥有政治智慧和军事实力，否则威斯特迈尔很可能会因此分裂成几个小王国。事实上，除非玩家角色进行干预，否则这是最有可能发生的事情，尽管这将经历数十年的阴谋、背叛和战争。",
	"By that time, the situation in Drakkenheim may become even more dire as the Haze grows larger and larger. In about a decade, containment will become almost impossible when more dimensional rifts and greater horrors begin to awaken within the crater. A few may callously conclude that the destruction is still centuries away, and so the Haze is a problem for future generations to inherit. Other powerful and wealthy recluses might selfishly plot to save themselves by fleeing to other worlds. Perhaps, a new generation of hopeful heroes may come together and try to save the world before it is too late.": "到那时，随着阴霾越来越大，德拉克肯海姆的形势可能会变得更加严峻。大约十年后，当更多的次元裂缝和更大的恐怖开始在陨石坑中苏醒时，控制将变得几乎不可能。少数人可能会冷酷地认为，毁灭还需要几个世纪的时间，所以阴霾是后代人要继承的问题。其他有权有势的隐居者可能会自私地谋划逃往其他世界，以求自保。也许，新一代满怀希望的英雄们会聚集在一起，试图在为时已晚之前拯救世界。",

	"The realm of Elyria lies on a large peninsula south of the Drakeclaw Mountains. The land comprises vast rolling prairies and river basins broken up by rocky arid hills and a mountainous coast. Nestled within are pockets of imposing pinewood forests, and great deposits of precious minerals such as gold and silver. Elyrians are known for being kind-hearted and outgoing folk eager to share the bounty of their land. Most live a rural life in small villages along the rivers and coasts. Indeed, the fertile river valleys at the heart of Elyria were an early cradle of civilization, and the countryside is dotted with the ruins of ancient cities.": "伊利里亚王国位于德雷克克劳山脉以南的一个大半岛上。这片土地上有连绵起伏的广阔草原和河流盆地，被干旱的岩石丘陵和多山的海岸分割开来。森林中生长着茂密的松树林和大量金银等珍贵矿藏。伊利里亚人以心地善良、热情好客、乐于分享土地上的丰饶而著称。大多数人在河流和海岸边的小村庄里过着乡村生活。事实上，位于伊利里亚中心地带的肥沃河谷是早期文明的摇篮，乡间遍布着古代城市的遗址。",

	"Originally, Elyria was a monarchy, but today, the nation is effectively a theocracy ruled by the Divine Matriarch. As leader of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch has traditionally been regarded as a pillar of wisdom, truth, and justice, so they often mediate difficult political matters. When the Elyrian royal line went extinct, a parliament drawn from the Elyrian nobility determined that the Divine Matriarch would appoint a Lord Regent to lead them.

As such, Caspians love to meddle in the politics of Elyria and Westemär. They often intermarry with the nobles of different realms to gain greater clout and influence for the next Kingsmoot.": "里海人每十年选举一次国王，候选人由贵族家族的王子提名。贵族家族的英勇事迹和声誉是决定国王人选的主要因素。虽然里海的政局总是风云变幻，尤其是在下一次国王选举临近的时候，但里海一直是一个非常稳定的国家。因此，里海人喜欢干涉伊利里亚和威斯特迈尔的政治。他们经常与不同王国的贵族通婚，以便在下一次国王大选中获得更大的影响力。",
