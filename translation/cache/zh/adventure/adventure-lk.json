	"This adventure is designed to be playable in three or four hours. The characters' goal is straightforward: they must search an abandoned castle for six magical lightning rods. When installed atop the battlements, these rods create a protective lightning field around the castle. By defending the castle in this way, the characters can provide a haven for refugees displaced by a marauding dragon. More information about the castle and the dragon can be found in later sections.": "这次冒险的设计可在三四个小时内完成。人物的目标很简单：他们必须在一座废弃的城堡中寻找六根神奇的避雷针。安装在城垛顶端后，这些避雷针会在城堡周围形成一个保护性雷电场。通过这种方式保卫城堡，角色们就能为因巨龙袭击而流离失所的难民提供避难所。有关城堡和巨龙的更多信息，请参阅后面的章节。",

	"The adventure fits easily into any campaign setting. All you need is a marauding dragon and a remote location for Lightning Keep. If you need help choosing a dragon, roll a (%0%) and consult the Dragon Suggestions table. The characters don't encounter the dragon in this adventure; it's meant to be a looming threat that could show up later in the campaign.": "该探险可轻松融入任何战役背景。您只需要一只掠夺龙和一个偏僻的闪电城堡。如果需要帮助选择龙，可以掷 (%0%) 并参考龙建议表。在这次冒险中，角色们不会遇到龙；它只是一个潜在的威胁，可能会在以后的战役中出现。",

No one knows where it came from, where it lairs, or how long it intends to terrorize the realm.": "一条掠夺性的巨龙毁坏了许多村庄，吞噬了一些居民，另一些则流离失所。它下手毫不留情。没有人知道它从哪里来，在哪里筑巢，也不知道它打算在这片土地上肆虐多久。",
	"But there is hope. Long ago, a werewolf knight of great valor used her wealth to raise a bastion at the edge of the wilderness. This castle had the power to generate a lightning shield around itself—a shield powerful enough to break sieges and keep monsters at bay. The castle was abandoned shortly after the knight passed away. By then, peace had settled across the land, making the stronghold unnecessary.": "但希望还是有的。很久以前，一位英勇的狼人骑士用她的财富在荒野边缘筑起了一座堡垒。这座城堡能在自身周围产生一个闪电护盾--这个护盾的威力足以打破围困，让怪物无处遁形。骑士去世后不久，城堡就被废弃了。那时，这片土地上已经实现了和平，没有必要再建造这个据点了。",
	"Villagers displaced by the dragon ask you to travel to Lightning Keep and rid it of any threats. Rumor has it the lightning shield is powered by six magical lightning rods. If you can find these rods, perhaps the lightning shield could be reactivated, allowing refugees fleeing the dragon to use the keep as a sanctuary.": "因龙而流离失所的村民们请求您前往闪电堡，消除一切威胁。有传言说，闪电护盾是由六根神奇的闪电棒驱动的。如果您能找到这些棒子，也许就能重新启动闪电护盾，让逃离巨龙的难民们把这里当作避难所。",

	"The wolves look hungry. If a character offers raw or cooked meat to a wolf, it accepts the offering and flees on its next turn, taking another wolf with it. If a character offers a wolf a bone instead, the wolf accepts the bone and becomes friendly toward that character, obeying the character's commands for the next 24 hours and departing afterward. Wolves that aren't given food or bones attack, hoping to make a meal of the party.": "狼看起来很饿。如果角色向狼提供生肉或熟肉，狼会接受并在下一回合逃跑，同时带走另一只狼。如果角色向狼提供骨头，狼会接受骨头并对角色友好，在接下来的 24 小时内服从角色的命令，然后离开。没有得到食物或骨头的狼会发动攻击，希望能吃掉一行人。",
	"As an action, a character can try to convince a wolf to leave peacefully on its next turn without an offering of food or a bone, doing so with a successful DC 11 Wisdom ((%0%)) check, or frighten a wolf into leaving on its next turn, which requires a successful DC 11 Charisma ((%1%)) check.": "作为一个动作，角色可以尝试说服狼在下一回合和平离开，无需提供食物或骨头，成功通过 DC 11 智慧（(%0%)）检定即可；或者吓唬狼让它在下一回合离开，成功通过 DC 11 魅力（(%1%)）检定即可。",

	"Once the wolves are dealt with, the characters can try to enter the keep by lifting the portcullis or by clever use of magic. Alternatively, they can use grappling hooks and ropes (or climber's kits) to scale the 6-metre-high outer wall. All these options are explained below:": "一旦解决了狼群，角色们就可以尝试抬起栅栏或巧妙地使用魔法进入城堡。此外，他们还可以使用抓钩和绳索（或攀爬工具包）攀爬 6 米高的外墙。下面将对所有这些方法进行说明：",

	"The top of the outer wall is 6 metre higher than the ground outside the keep, and the wall is too smooth to climb without proper gear or magic (such as a (%0%) spell). A character equipped with climbing gear can use it to try to scale the wall, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength ((%1%)) check.": "外墙的顶端比城堡外的地面高出 6 米，而且墙壁过于光滑，没有适当的装备或魔法（例如（%0%）咒语）是无法攀爬的。装备有攀爬装备的角色可以尝试攀爬墙壁，成功通过 DC 10 力量（（%1%））检定即可。",
	"As an action, a character can try to lift the portcullis, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength ((%0%)) check. The character can cause the portcullis to drop by letting go of it. Holding it up requires continuous effort; the character doing so must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, the character's strength gives out, and the portcullis drops. (The portcullis can also be raised and lowered using the winch in (%1%).)": "作为一个动作，角色可以尝试抬起栅栏，成功通过 DC 20 力量（(%0%)）检定即可。该角色可以通过放手使舷窗放下。举起栅栏需要持续的努力；举起栅栏的角色必须在每个回合开始时成功通过 DC 15 的力量蓄力。如果蓄力失败，角色的体力就会耗尽，栅栏就会掉落。(舷窗也可以使用（%1%）中的绞盘升降）。",

Once they find the rods, the characters can test the lighting shield by inserting the rods into the six cornerstones of the battlements (see (%0%)).": "进入城堡后，角色需要找到六根神奇的避雷针。找到棒子后，角色们就可以将棒子插入城垛的六块基石中（参见 (%0%)）来测试照明盾。",
