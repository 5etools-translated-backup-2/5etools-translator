	"From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrific aberrations lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountain ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. However, the true monsters of this land are found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.": "从潜伏着恐怖异类的幽深禁林，到埋藏着失落遗产的巍峨险峻的山脉，伊塔瑞斯的地貌令人生畏。然而，这片土地上真正的怪物却出现在人类苟延残喘的堕落古城中。邪恶的人物诱惑着那些追求权力的人，而死神的信徒则惩罚那些不虔诚的人。在这样一个道德败坏的世界里，英雄寥寥无几。伊萨瑞斯唯一的希望就是你自己。",

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters.

	"Like the salvage rules, lore plays an important part in a dark fantasy setting. Characters may be in trouble if they don't take the time to learn more about the monsters they face. Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the folk tales, there could be an iota of truth—and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.": "与打捞规则一样，传说在黑暗奇幻设定中也扮演着重要角色。如果角色不花时间了解他们所面对的怪物的更多信息，就可能会遇到麻烦。当地关于怪兽的传说可能是神话或愚弄，但即使在民间传说中，也可能有一丝一毫的真实性--而这种真实性可能就是遭遇战中幸存与最终失败之间的区别。",

Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences.": "与每种怪物相关的能力检定旨在提供角色可能知道的关于怪物的详细信息，或者角色可能发现的信息。使用这些检定来提供重要信息。有些检查可能需要角色做一些研究，甚至面对怪物观察它的特征和行为。失败的检查可能会导致角色获得错误或片面的信息，从而导致可怕的后果。",

The creatures it has pressed into service rest comfortably in their nest, content that the faevlin bring them enough snacks—and that the faevlin themselves are always available as snacks if necessary. A small tribe of nine faevlin are spread out across the Bone House. One is assisting the bone trader with its work. Two are moving supplies into the ruined cabin. Two more are searching the refuse pit for trinkets and gold.

This is reduced to 5 gp each if they are only able to convince the bone trader to agree not to hunt the people, leaving the animals as fair game. Obviously, if the characters make a deal that saves their own bones but doesn't account for nearby villages' needs, the villages won't pay them anything!": "角色可能会与骨头商人争论，并最终达成交易。村民们通常没有很多钱可以作为报酬，所以他们提供的报酬可能是信息（也许会带来新的冒险）或钦佩。如果有必要，村民可以给角色每人 10 古普，以说服骨商停止捕食他们。如果他们只能说服骨商同意不捕杀人类，而把动物当作公平的猎物，那么每人就可以得到 5 个金币。很显然，如果角色们做的交易能保住他们自己的骨头，但没有考虑到附近村庄的需要，那么村庄就不会付给他们任何东西！",
	"Dealing with the bone trader could be the first step toward helping a local ruler regain control of their fiefdom, leading the characters back to them for another quest against sinister forces in these lands. The bone trader may mention that its own actions are limited by an even greater bone trader in another vale—one who has several bone trader vassals of its own! Or, perhaps, the bone trader is annoyed because the characters have been sent in breach of an existing contract, and the next adventure for the characters investigates who sent them into a deadly situation to get rid of Fibekruk!": "与骨商打交道可能是帮助当地统治者夺回领地的第一步，从而引导角色回到他们身边，与这片土地上的邪恶势力进行另一次较量。骨商可能会提到，自己的行动受到另一个山谷中更强大的骨商的限制--这个骨商拥有自己的几个附庸！或者，骨商可能会恼羞成怒，因为他们违反了现有的合约，而角色们的下一次冒险就是要调查是谁把他们送入了一个致命的境地，以摆脱菲贝克鲁克！",

Over time, it became an important waystation: a stable and a small hamlet grew up around the inn. A few generations ago, a local baron (Faren) got the bright idea to put a tax collector at the waystation. He quickly abused the tax, building a house across from the inn to keep an eye on things—along with a statue of himself as a heroic warrior. Eventually one of the baron's many enemies did him in, and Faren's Rest became independent once again.": "法伦之息是一个沿着主要贸易路线发展起来的路边村庄。曾经，它只是一家客栈和酒馆。随着时间的推移，它变成了一个重要的中转站：一个马厩和一个小村庄围绕着客栈发展起来。几代人之前，当地的一位男爵（法伦）灵机一动，在驿站里安插了一个收税员。他很快就滥收税款，并在客栈对面建了一座房子来监视一切--还为自己塑了一座英雄战士的雕像。最后，男爵的众多敌人中的一个把他干掉了，法伦之息再次独立。",

Rose has grown greedy in her years of avoiding discovery and sees in Rolant an opportunity to play the long game and accumulate wealth from the old tax. Eventually, she figures, the town will get mad at Rolant (or she will use up her host), and either way she will be seen as the \"innocent victim\" rather than an unworthy beneficiary of the wealth, and she can disappear again. Unfortunately, her domination of Rolant is making him behave very strangely, and some in town fear something is wrong.": "酗酒者扮演的是市长收留的自称 \"罗丝 \"的可怜孤儿。罗丝在躲避追捕的岁月里变得越来越贪婪，她从罗兰特身上看到了一个玩长线游戏、从旧税中积累财富的机会。最终，她认为镇上的人会对罗兰特发火（或者她会用完她的主人），不管怎样，她都会被看作是 \"无辜的受害者\"，而不是不值得的财富受益者，这样她就可以再次消失了。不幸的是，她对罗兰特的控制让他的行为变得非常奇怪，镇上的一些人担心出了什么问题。",
	"There are a few ways the characters might be involved. The easiest is that the inn and tavern (The Outrageous Pig) is a recommended waystation for the party. Perhaps they're on the way to another adventure, or perhaps they are returning from one.

Betha is more than willing to share her positive opinion about Rolant (and how he has changed recently), and if the characters ask what might have changed him, the only thing she can think of is adopting Rose.

	"Most of the books the bloodbonded has acquired are written in Celestial and center on superstitions and folktales that are 90 percent fiction and 10 percent fact. They are dry grimoires with no literary value or illustrations. Only one book on the shelves stands out from the rest: The Mad Treatise. When the bloodbonded hits a dead end in its summoning attempts, it spends some time adding to its experimental log.

The priests and mages who built the citadel did so through the favors of the common people: curses in exchange for a year of service building, guarding, maintaining, or cooking for the stronghold. Of course, payment in Shadowsteel or sufficient gold was also acceptable, allowing the rich to buy their curses as the poor pledged their service.": "在巨龙到来之前，这个山区据点是一个公开的秘密。它建在一个大型定居点附近，随时都能得到日用品和赞助，它远离文明，当权者不需要受到它的威胁。这座城堡以宗教般的狂热追求着一个目标：诅咒。建造要塞的牧师和法师们通过平民的恩惠来实现这一目标：用诅咒换取一年的服务，为要塞建造、守卫、维护或烹饪。当然，用暗影钢或足够的黄金支付也是可以接受的，这样富人就可以购买诅咒，而穷人则可以承诺提供服务。",

If your adventures have taken your characters far from any city, feel free instead to put this necropolis above the first level of a dungeon or just below a ruined wilderness temple.": "另一种情况是，亡灵卫城可能仍然被封印着，但重要人物（可能包括角色）会收到亡灵从坟墓中复活并摧毁城市的可怕幻象。这些幻象都以一个红白相间的石头结构图像结束，该结构上刻有红玛瑙石。城市图书馆的研究发现了亡灵卫城的存在，角色必须在最坏的情况发生之前前往那里与幻象的源头对质。如果您的角色在冒险过程中远离任何城市，那么可以将这座亡灵卫城放在地牢第一层的上方或废墟荒野神庙的下方。",
	"The necropolis is underground, where natural light never penetrates. While there are torch sconces and braziers for oil spread throughout the area, none are stocked. Characters who put torches in the sconces or oil in the braziers and light them draw the undead like moths to a flame. Clever characters may use this strategy to draw undead where they want them, but since the dead are drawn to the light, they may get more than they bargain for! Descriptions assume the characters have some way to see but not necessarily in color.": "墓地位于地下，自然光无法进入。虽然这里到处都有火把烛台和盛油的篝火，但都没有储备。将火把插在烛台上或将油倒入篝火中点燃的角色会像飞蛾扑火一样吸引亡灵。聪明的角色可以使用这种策略将亡灵引到他们想要的地方，但由于亡灵是被光吸引来的，他们可能会得不偿失！描述假定角色可以看到一些东西，但不一定是彩色的。",
	"Without a necromancer controlling them, most of the dead are listless; they \"patrol\" a small area around their graves but lack a sense of past or future that would cause them to change that routine without outside stimuli. If using the city-under-siege model, the characters should not have time to descend at night but should be strongly encouraged to enter during the day. If they spend too long, the corpse walkers gather the undead hordes and lead them to the surface to pillage and destroy—possibly creating even more undead—before returning to the necropolis.": "没有死灵法师的控制，大多数亡灵都是无精打采的；他们在坟墓周围的小范围内 \"巡逻\"，但缺乏对过去或未来的感知，因此在没有外界刺激的情况下，他们不会改变这种生活方式。如果使用 \"围城 \"模式，角色不应该在晚上下城，而应该大力鼓励他们在白天下城。如果时间过长，行尸就会聚集亡灵大军，带领他们到地面上进行掠夺和破坏--可能会制造出更多的亡灵，然后再返回亡灵之城。",
	"The natural caverns you've traversed give way to precisely worked cobblestones, a twenty-foot-wide road leading to an enormous stone structure, studded with gemstones, that is covered in angular depictions of soldiers drilling, angels floating, and families crying. Gravestones are spaced to the north and south.": "您走过的天然洞穴让位给了经过精密加工的鹅卵石，一条 20 英尺宽的道路通向一个巨大的石头建筑，上面镶满了宝石，刻满了士兵钻孔、天使漂浮和家人哭泣等棱角分明的图案。墓碑分布在南北两侧。",

	"Though the structure is magnificent, some expense was spared in its construction: only one in every 10 gemstones that sparkle on the structure are real sardonyx, worth 50 gp each. The rest are colored glass baubles. Characters proficient with jeweler's tools or glassblower's tools notice the difference immediately if attempting to remove one from the wall; otherwise, there is only a 10 percent chance that a given gemstone is real. There are 100 stones across each of the three entrances to the necropolis's main structure, 10 of which are real in each case. Prying a stone from the wall takes 5 minutes and an appropriate tool (such as a crowbar or piton and hammer). Glass fakes shatter after a minute of attempted extraction.": "虽然这座建筑宏伟壮观，但在建造过程中也不惜工本：在建筑上闪闪发光的每 10 颗宝石中，只有 1 颗是真正的红玛瑙，每颗价值 50 古普。其余的都是彩色玻璃饰品。精通珠宝工匠工具或玻璃工匠工具的角色如果试图从墙上取下一颗宝石，就会立即发现其中的差别；否则，只有 10% 的几率可以确定某颗宝石是真的。亡灵卫城主建筑的三个入口处各有 100 颗宝石，其中每处都有 10 颗是真的。从墙上撬开一块石头需要 5 分钟和一个合适的工具（如撬棍或凿子和锤子）。玻璃假石在尝试撬动一分钟后就会碎裂。",

	"The statue depicts Julara, an angel of health and former servant of Aurelia (now an ally of Miklas). Characters who clear off the fungus from the base of the statue discover a plate inscribed with the following prayer: \"Julara, angel of health, protect us from disease and death.\" The blessing of Julara is potent: cleaning the statue grants characters who participate in the cleaning advantage on saves against disease while in the necropolis.": "雕像描绘的是健康天使朱拉娜，她曾是奥瑞莉娅的仆人（现在是米克拉斯的盟友）。清除了雕像底座上真菌的角色们发现了一个刻有以下祷文的盘子： \"朱拉娜，健康天使，请保护我们远离疾病和死亡\"。朱拉娜的祝福非常有效：清理雕像会让参与清理的角色在亡灵卫城中获得抗病优势。",

Worse, he has seen the prophet's proclamations of curses and daemonic invasion come true.

He claims to have no knowledge of any monsters, thievery, or kidnappings but is happy to sit and discuss it, asking the party to tell him everything that has happened.": "里克鳞人住在这里。当角色们到达时，有 20 (%0%)* 人正在做饭、照顾幼崽、打磨武器和整理赃物。如果冒险者现身，他们会尽量躲起来。只剩下奎塔克-黑舌（(%1%)）为部落说话。奎塔克是舒娜-乌比特尔（(%2%)）的学徒，因此在哥布林中受到一定程度的尊重。奎塔克意识到，如果没有舒娜和她的保镖，部落很容易就会被大多数冒险者消灭，因此他拖延时间，欢迎他们来到利克鳞人的洞穴，共享篝火。他声称对任何怪物、偷窃或绑架事件都一无所知，但很乐意坐下来讨论，并要求一行人把发生的一切都告诉他。",
	"While he talks, one of the kobolds sneaks through the small tunnel to area 4 to alert Shuuna, who in turn goes to warn the lindwyrms. If the Tolfersons are dropped into the Nursery Pit, their screams are easily heard in this room.": "在他说话的时候，一个哥布林偷偷穿过小隧道来到 4 号区域，向舒娜发出警报，舒娜则去警告林德维亚人。如果托弗森一家掉进了育婴坑，他们的尖叫声很容易在这个房间里传开。",
	"As you approach a foul sulfurous smell adds to the fetid rotten meat smell that permeates the tunnels. The sounds of cracking and hissing can be heard echoing from the chamber.": "当您走近时，隧道中弥漫的腐肉臭味中又多了一股硫磺味。密室中还回荡着破裂声和嘶嘶声。",
	"The lindwyrms have lain seventeen eggs and so far, two newborn lindwyrms (treat as (%0%)) have hatched. Shuuna Crowbiter (kobold (%1%)) and her bodyguards Schminge and Schux (kobold (%2%)) are in the process feeding the newborns. They have just fed each a sheep and are about to toss the captured farmers to the newborns. If the kobolds see or hear the characters coming, or are warned, they start cutting the ropes and drop the captives as quickly as possible.

If they are dropped, a newborn lindwyrm can kill one per bite, but then spends a round to swallow its prey.": "这里有五个托弗森人，由于最近被暴力抓捕，他们的状况都很糟糕： 鲁恩、维格迪斯、乌尔弗里克（被称为 \"雪泳者\"）、阿斯吉恩和纳塔拉。他们被单独捆绑，用绳索吊在窗台上，距离窗台五英尺，距离坑底十英尺。如果它们掉了下来，新生林德威姆每咬一口就能杀死一只，但要花费一轮时间才能吞下猎物。",

Eater of Men has a longsword of Valikan make stuck in his scales, behind his left claw. This is the sword Ingrind Settur seeks. The lindwyrms are happy to feast on the adventurers, yet another meal delivered directly to them.": "两个 (%0%)* 被哥布林称为嗜血者和噬人者，他们在这里休息，正在祭坛旁的一堆牲畜上大快朵颐。噬人者左爪后的鳞片上插着一把瓦里坎制造的长剑。这就是英格林德-塞图尔要找的剑。林德维亚人很乐意享用冒险者们的大餐，这是又一顿直接送到他们面前的大餐。",
	"The kobolds have piled many years' worth of stolen armor, weapons, trade goods, coins, and other knickknacks on a large flat stone.

As bodies accumulate everywhere the characters go, rumors begin to circulate that the party is cursed, or possibly evil.": "如果英格林德-塞图尔父亲的剑被找回来，她就会向人物歃血为盟，效忠为她父亲复仇的英雄，尽管她还不能举起父亲的剑。她的眼神中充满了黑暗的愤怒，如果不加以控制，可能会演变成邪恶的堕落。如果角色们让她独自一人，誓言就会对女孩造成沉重的压力，她就会变成一个杀人犯，杀死她认为是角色们的敌人或诋毁者。随着游戏人物所到之处尸体堆积如山，谣传开始流传，说游戏人物受到了诅咒，或者可能是恶魔。",

	"A downcast apostate called Master Krumm wanted to become immortal again, and he planned to perform dark rituals to make that happen. After being driven away from two different lairs by interfering adventurers, he sought a place where no one would bother him: the Stillborn Forest. Krumm found abandoned lodgings upon which to build his new home, including a small manor and a house for servants. Within a month, Krumm and his followers had created a well for water, a garden for food, abundant game for meat, and Krumm knew privacy like they never had before.": "一个名叫克鲁姆大师的落魄叛教者想要再次长生不老，他计划通过举行黑暗仪式来实现这一愿望。在被冒险者从两个不同的巢穴中赶走后，他找到了一个没有人会打扰他的地方：死寂森林。克鲁姆找到了被遗弃的住处，并在此基础上建造了自己的新家，包括一座小庄园和一栋仆人房。不到一个月，克鲁姆和他的追随者们就打出了一口水井，建起了一座花园，有了食物，有了丰富的野味，克鲁姆也对隐私有了前所未有的了解。",
	"Once established in their new dwellings, Krumm's entourage scoured their area of the forest, finding a few woodcutters, hunters, and scouts. Krumm and his lackeys captured these folks in preparation to attempt yet another ritualistic sacrifice to reestablish Krumm's immortality.": "在新住处安顿下来后，克鲁姆的随从在森林里四处搜寻，找到了一些伐木工人、猎人和侦察兵。克鲁姆和他的走狗们抓住了这些人，准备进行又一次祭祀，以重建克鲁姆的永生。",
	"All seemed well for Krumm's plan until some roving xakalonuses noticed the new settlement. Krumm repelled their first attack, although they destroyed the home of his servants and many of the trees in the area. The xakalonuses can smell the delicious, magic-infused brain of the downcast apostate, and they know it will make a wonderful meal for their progenitor, the hraptnon.": "克鲁姆的计划似乎一切顺利，直到一些游荡的 xakalonuses 发现了这个新定居点。克鲁姆击退了他们的第一次进攻，尽管他们摧毁了他仆人的家和该地区的许多树木。xakalonuses 闻到了沮丧的叛徒那充满魔力的美味大脑，它们知道这将是它们的祖先 hraptnon 的美餐。",
	"When the characters arrive at the lair, they find themselves caught in the middle of an ongoing struggle between Master Krumm and several xakalonuses, with the hraptnon about to arrive on the scene to take what it feels belongs to it: the life of any living creature in the Stillborn Forest.": "当角色们到达巢穴时，他们发现自己陷入了克鲁姆大师和几只夏卡龙之间持续不断的争斗之中，而夏卡龙即将来到现场，夺走它认为属于自己的东西：史迪威森林中任何生物的生命。",
	"A small but thriving hamlet called Oakendale rests at the edge of the Stillborn Forest. It acts as a gathering point for those brave souls who ply their trade in the forest as woodcutters, loggers, hunters, and treasure seekers. The leader of the town, a woman named Yvell Stowin, oversees the mercantile businesses that operate in and through Oakendale, acting as a de facto guildmistress. When many more foresters than normal fail to return from their work in a timely manner, Yvell reaches out to adventurers to enter the dangerous forest and see what the problem might be.": "在史迪博恩森林的边缘，有一个名为奥肯代尔（Oakendale）的小村庄，虽然不大，却很繁荣。这里是那些在森林中从事伐木、伐木、打猎和寻宝等行业的勇士们的聚集地。小镇的首领是一位名叫伊维尔-斯托文（Yvell Stowin）的女士，她负责监督奥肯代尔镇内和镇外的商贸业务，是事实上的女行会会长。当有更多的森林守护者未能及时完成工作返回时，伊维尔向冒险者发出了邀请，希望他们能进入危险的森林，看看问题出在哪里。",
	"Yvell can provide a map of the main logging roads at the edges of the forest, showing the area that supplies Oakendale with its resources. (Krumm's new estate rests one of those logging roads, and Yvell is unaware of its presence.) She can also regale the adventurers with the legend of the hraptnon, which contains an interesting mixture of truth and wild speculation. Discerning which of these tales are true and which are false is up to the characters.": "伊维尔可以提供一张森林边缘主要伐木道路的地图，显示为奥肯代尔提供资源的区域。(克鲁姆的新庄园就位于其中一条伐木路旁，而伊维尔并不知道它的存在）。她还可以向冒险者们讲述关于赫拉普顿的传说，其中既有真实的故事，也有荒诞的猜测。至于其中哪些是真，哪些是假，就要靠冒险者们自己去辨别了。",
	"Yvell can truthfully avow to an increase in sightings of creatures called xakalonuses in the area in the last several days. These creatures are very dangerous, but the local militia is experienced at driving away threats. The only time a xakalonus didn't flee after taking some heavy longbow fire was when there was a mage in town doing research on the hraptnon. In that case, the xakalonuses did not retreat until one of them had attacked the mage, ripping off the top of his head and eating his brain. Yvell offers the characters a total of 500 gp to put an end to the attacks and find the cause of the missing foresters.": "伊维尔可以如实证实，最近几天在该地区发现的名为 xakalonuses 的生物有所增加。这些生物非常危险，但当地民兵在驱赶威胁方面经验丰富。唯一一次 xakalonus 在遭到长弓猛烈射击后没有逃走的情况是，当时镇上有一名法师正在研究 hraptnon。在这种情况下，xakalonus 直到其中一只攻击了法师，扯掉了他的头顶并吃掉了他的大脑后才撤退。伊维尔总共给了角色 500 古普，让他们停止攻击并找到森林守护者失踪的原因。",
	"Xakalonus attacks have increased dramatically all over Etharis, with most of those attacks happening against people who use magic. After attacking magic-users and eating their brains, the xakalonuses immediately retreat. More than one report has pointed to the Stillborn Forest as the ultimate destination of these brain-eating creatures, so the characters are prompted to investigate.": "伊萨瑞斯各地的 Xakalonus 攻击事件急剧增加，其中大部分都是针对使用魔法的人。在攻击使用魔法的人并吃掉他们的大脑后，xakalonus 会立即撤退。不止一份报告指出，这些食脑怪的最终目的地是死灵森林，因此他们被要求进行调查。",
	"The Stillborn Forest is thick with trees, underbrush, wild game, and even some lesser fey creatures. Moving off established paths means entering (%0%), and the countless trees offer much concealment and cover from ranged attacks.": "死灵森林里有茂密的树木、灌木丛、野味，甚至还有一些较低等的精灵生物。离开既定的路径意味着进入 (%0%)，而无数的树木则为躲避远程攻击提供了很多隐蔽和掩护。",
	"Also, the simple trodden path is replaced with a road paved with stones.": "此外，简单的人行道也被铺满石子的道路所取代。",
	"Thick, luxuriously leafed oak and pine trees teem in this area of the Stillborn Forest. As you travel, however, you notice some changes: the trees on one side of the road thin out a bit, where they appear sickly and stripped of leaves. Fewer forest-dwelling creatures chitter at you from their dens and perches. Felled logs form a rough barrier on each side of the path, slowing plant growth over the path.": "厚实繁茂的橡树和松树在史迪威森林的这片区域生机勃勃。然而，当你行进时，你会注意到一些变化：道路一侧的树木变得稀疏了一些，它们显得病怏怏的，叶子也被剥光了。越来越少的林中生物从它们的巢穴和栖息地向你发出叽叽喳喳的叫声。砍伐的原木在道路两侧形成了一道粗糙的屏障，减缓了道路上植物的生长速度。",
	"In the distance, on either side of the path, are a pair of wooden structures. Although they are difficult to see through the thick foliage, you can discern a few details. The structure to the west of the path, on the same side as the sickly trees, has obviously sustained structural damage. The structure on the eastern side of the path is in better shape.": "远处，小路两侧有一对木制建筑。虽然透过茂密的树叶很难看到它们，但还是可以看出一些细节。小路西侧的木结构建筑与病树位于同一侧，其结构显然已经受损。而小路东侧的建筑则情况较好。",
	"The characters get a better view only if they approach or use magic. The current lull in the battle between Krumm's contingent and the xakalonuses means there's nothing to hear from the road.": "只有走近或使用魔法，人物才能获得更好的视野。克鲁姆的队伍和夏卡洛努斯人之间的战斗目前处于停滞状态，这意味着路上没有任何消息。",
	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom ((%0%)) check identifies tracks of Medium-sized and booted humanoid creatures, along with some domesticated animals like horses. More recent tracks to and from the area were made by xakalonuses, which look like large wolf tracks but with much sharper claws.": "成功的 DC 15 智慧（(%0%)）检定可以辨认出中型和长靴类人生物的足迹，以及一些驯养动物（如马）的足迹。最近进出该地区的足迹是由 xakalonuses 留下的，它们看起来像大狼的足迹，但爪子更锋利。",
	"If the characters take a moment to examine the corrupted trees along the west of the path, they can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence ((%0%) or (%1%)) check. On a success, they learn that these trees were at one point magical, infused with a type of fey magic. Something drained the magic from them, leaving them alive but severely damaged.": "如果角色花点时间检查一下小路西边被腐蚀的树木，他们可以尝试进行 DC 20 智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查。如果成功，他们就会了解到这些树曾一度具有魔力，并注入了一种翡冷翠魔法。有什么东西吸干了它们的魔力，使它们虽然还活着，但已经严重受损。",
	"The magic of the trees was drained by the presence of the xakalonuses as they moved through the area recently. Unless the characters have explicit knowledge of the xakalonus, however, they have no way of knowing their presence was the cause of this corruption of the trees. However, when the characters see magic fail to affect those creatures, they might figure it out.": "这些树木的魔力在最近由于 xakalonuses 的存在而被耗尽，因为它们最近在这一地区活动。然而，除非角色们明确了解夏卡洛努斯，否则他们无法知道是它们的存在导致了树木的腐蚀。不过，当角色们看到魔法无法影响这些生物时，他们可能就会明白了。",
	"Two sets of five (%0%)* each wait to the north and south of the Krumm's Manor ((%1%)). They watch the situation, waiting for the hraptnon to arrive and take part in a final assault against the occupants of the manor. The characters' presence throws their plan into question.

	"This building housed Krumm's mundane servants: cooks, farmers, animal keepers, etc. They locked themselves in the building when the xakalonuses attacked, but the monsters entered the building and killed everyone inside, chasing down those who attempted to flee.": "这栋楼里住着克鲁姆的普通仆人：厨师、农夫、动物饲养员等。当沙卡隆人发动攻击时，他们把自己锁在楼里，但怪物进入楼里杀死了里面的所有人，并追杀试图逃跑的人。",
	"A character succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ((%0%) or (%1%)) check determines that while it looks like the damage to the building was caused by an earthquake, the damage is too localized and specific. Highly concentrated thunder damage was the cause of the damage to the building.": "成功通过 DC 15 智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查的角色可以确定，虽然建筑物的损坏看起来像是地震造成的，但损坏过于局部和特殊。高度集中的雷击是建筑物受损的原因。",
	"The three corpses in the front lawn belonged to members of Master Krumm's staff: a cook, a farmer, and a woodcutter. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ((%0%)) check determines that the bodies where slain by claws and bites from a rather larger creature. On the body of the cook is a key, which opens the back door of Krumm's manor.": "前院草坪上的三具尸体分别属于克鲁姆主人的手下：一名厨师、一名农夫和一名樵夫。通过 DC 15 的智慧（（%0%））检定，可以确定这些尸体是被一个体型更大的生物的爪子和咬死的。厨师的尸体上有一把钥匙，可以打开克鲁姆庄园的后门。",

Krumm paid well but insisted on secrecy, insisting that Feder tell no one where he was going or who he was serving.": "在过去的两个月里，克鲁姆和他的大约 20 名员工创建了这个小型定居点。大部分员工现在都死在仆人的住所里。克鲁姆支付了丰厚的报酬，但坚持保密，坚持不让费德尔告诉任何人他要去哪里，为谁服务。",
	"They were attacked today by large wolf-like creatures lacking hair. Their howls shattered windows and buckled doors.": "它们今天遭到了没有毛发的大型狼类生物的袭击。它们的嚎叫声震碎了窗户，撞开了大门。",
	"Krumm is probably in his manor house, assuming he survived the attack. The Master is a powerful arcanist who sought this remote place to perform his research.": "克鲁姆可能在他的庄园里，假设他在袭击中幸存的话。大师是一位强大的奥术师，他来到这个偏僻的地方进行研究。",

	"Master Krumm ((%0%)*) is locked within his home, waiting for the next barrage from the xakalonuses.

	"Master Krumm's rituals to regain his immortality failed for one simple reason: none of his sacrifices were powerful enough in spirit or magic to ignite the divine spark in him. With the characters, he sees several potential sparks. This leaves him in a quandary: he may need the characters to help hold off further attacks, but if he can kill one to complete the ritual, he can regain immortality, so defending against the attack won't matter.": "克鲁姆大师恢复长生不老的仪式失败了，原因很简单：他的祭品在精神或魔法上都不够强大，无法点燃他心中的神圣火花。在这些人物身上，他看到了几种潜在的火花。这让他左右为难：他可能需要这些角色来帮助他抵挡进一步的攻击，但如果他能杀死一个角色来完成仪式，他就能恢复不死之身，所以抵挡攻击并不重要。",

However, the creature may go after a more accessible target who is almost as powerful.": "当 hraptnon 来到这里时，它的本能就是瞄准拥有最强魔法能力的生物。这很可能是 18 级施法者克鲁姆大师。不过，该生物也可能会去找一个更容易接近的目标，而这个目标的魔力也几乎同样强大。",

	"If what could turn into a three-way battle results in the characters' victory, they learn that the foresters' disappearance was caused by both the hraptnon and xakalonuses, as well as the machinations of Master Krumm. Bringing Krumm back to Oakendale for justice settles the affair in the eyes of Yvell, who gratefully provides the promised reward.": "如果这场可能演变成三方大战的战斗最终以主人公们的胜利而告终，那么他们就会知道森林守护者们的失踪既是哈普顿人和夏卡隆人造成的，也是克鲁姆大师的阴谋诡计造成的。在伊维尔看来，将克鲁姆带回奥肯代尔讨回公道就解决了这件事，而他也非常感激地提供了许诺的奖励。",
	"Unfortunately for the characters, unless they find the hraptnon's magical Stillborn Heart at the grove in the center of the Stillborn Forest, a new hraptnon appears within 24 hours of the original's demise. It is likely that the new hraptnon gathers a large force of xakalonuses, and maybe some other deadly forest creatures, and assaults Oakendale directly, hoping to gorge on the brains of any arcane characters.": "不幸的是，除非他们在 Stillborn 森林中心的小树林里找到 Hraptnon 神奇的 Stillborn 之心，否则新的 Hraptnon 会在原 Hraptnon 死亡后 24 小时内出现。新的 hraptnon 很可能聚集了大量的 xakalonuses，也许还有其他一些致命的森林生物，直接袭击了奥肯戴尔，希望能啃食任何奥术人物的大脑。",

Zeragonia found this region suffused with lycanthropy after a visit from the Great Beast, and she established a cave complex to harbor lycanthropes trying to learn to control their affliction. An acolyte of Miklas, Zeragonia calls upon that Arch Seraph's power to aide her in healing her charges, or at least helping them control themselves.": "作为一种蔑视希望的不死生物，杰科蒂在乡间四处游荡，只要发现希望和欢乐，他就会将其扼杀在摇篮里。最近，他找到了一个机会，可以破坏一个名叫泽拉戈尼亚的狼人苦行僧的希望和梦想。泽拉戈尼亚在巨兽来访后发现这个地区充斥着狼人的气息，于是她建立了一个洞穴群，收容那些试图学会控制自己痛苦的狼人。作为米克拉斯的信徒，泽拉戈尼亚借助大蛇神的力量来帮助她治疗她的病人，或者至少帮助他们控制自己。",
	"When Jacoty learned of Zeragonia's ministrations, he found a new focus for his evil intentions. He wormed his way into Zeragonia's cavern-home, and he is using his powers to subvert Zeragonia and corrupt her followers. He's already taken control of the lair and of those whom the werebear attempted to help, and he's almost completed the process of turning Zeragonia herself to the side of darkness.": "当杰科蒂知道了泽拉戈尼亚的事迹后，他为自己的邪恶意图找到了新的目标。他潜入了泽拉戈尼亚的洞穴，并利用自己的力量颠覆泽拉戈尼亚，腐蚀她的追随者。他已经控制了巢穴和那些熊人试图帮助的人，而且他几乎已经完成了将泽拉戈尼亚自己变成黑暗一方的过程。",
	"A sighting of the Great Beast in the area has led to a severe and dangerous increase in lycanthropy. While the Beast has vanished from the area, the citizens are left to deal with the aftermath. Lycanthropes ravage the area. To make matters worse, people in the region are disappearing. Others talk about experiencing lost time.": "在该地区发现的巨兽导致了严重而危险的变狼症。虽然巨兽已从该地区消失，但市民们却不得不处理善后事宜。狼人在该地区肆虐。更糟糕的是，该地区的人们也在不断消失。其他人则在谈论失去的时间。",
	"Scouts tracked some lycanthropes to a cave opening on the edges of civilization. The scouts who entered the cave never emerged, and one of the scouts left behind to watch the cave opening went mad, claiming that she'd been gone for a year when she was actually gone for no more than a couple of days. Local authorities beg the characters to investigate.": "童子军追踪一些狼人来到文明边缘的一个洞口。进入洞穴的童子军再也没有出现，留下看守洞口的一名童子军发疯了，声称自己离开了一年，而实际上她离开的时间不过几天。当地政府恳求人物进行调查。",

	"As he can affect the passage of time within his lair, Jacoty can take one long rest at any point while the characters are trapped within the caverns in less than a minute's time. He may only do this once, however. Alternately, if the characters attempt to take a long rest, Jacoty teleports in to make sure they cannot get a full rest.": "由于杰科蒂可以影响巢穴中时间的流逝，因此当角色被困在洞穴中不到一分钟的时间内，他可以在任何时候进行一次长时间休息。但他只能这样做一次。或者，如果角色试图进行长时间休息，杰科蒂会传送过来确保他们无法完全休息。",

	"Early in this combat, Jacoty ((%0%)*) teleports into the area and spends a round or two attacking the characters, telling them that they are never going to leave this lair alive. After testing their mettle and taking in their tactics and capabilities, he pops away to deal with them later elsewhere in the cavern lair. He repeats this process in other areas, hounding the characters and then disappearing before he is seriously injured.": "在战斗初期，杰科蒂（(%0%)*）会瞬移到该区域，并花一两个回合攻击角色，告诉他们绝不能活着离开这个巢穴。在试探了他们的胆量并了解了他们的战术和能力后，他就会突然出现，稍后在洞穴巢穴的其他地方对付他们。他还会在其他地方重复这个过程，对角色进行围攻，然后在受重伤之前消失。",

Whoever wrote and drew these works is obviously heartbroken by the loss of Hosken.": "写字台上有诗歌、笔记、半成品故事和素描。所有这些都是雅各蒂写的，但他没有在任何作品上署名。这些文件都传达了一种失落感，而这些作品的主题是一个名叫霍斯肯的人，他显然已经去世了，但没有一件作品确切地描述了他是谁或他是如何去世的。无论是谁写的或画的这些作品，显然都为失去霍斯肯而伤心欲绝。",

	"The stone wall can magically expand or retract to block or allow access. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ((%0%)) check reveals that the runes on the wall function as a lock. When a spell of level 1 or higher is cast on the wall, it opens for 10 seconds to allow passage. Then it closes, needing magic to re-open again. Magic cast on the wall is instantly absorbed, so spells that would affect the door do not. Each five-foot section of the wall has an AC of 25 and 200 hit points.": "石墙可以神奇地扩张或收缩，以阻挡或允许进入。成功通过 DC 15 智力（(%0%)）检查后，会发现墙上的符文具有锁的功能。当对石墙施放 1 级或更高级别的魔法时，石墙会打开 10 秒钟以允许通行。然后它会关闭，需要魔法才能再次打开。对墙壁施放的魔法会被立即吸收，因此会影响门的魔法不会被吸收。每段五英尺长的墙壁 AC 值为 25，命中点数为 200。",

Zeragonia was interested in what those troubles might be, sensing a deeper darkness dwelling within him.": "这本日记是用代码写成的，时间跨度为过去两年，讲述了泽拉格尼娅个人与变狼症的斗争，米克拉斯是如何帮助她克服这种痛苦的，以及她是如何创建这个地方来安全地帮助其他变狼症患者控制他们的暴力本能的。最后一条记载了一个名叫杰科蒂的陌生人的到来，他似乎遇到了麻烦。泽拉戈尼亚很想知道他的烦恼是什么，因为她感觉到了他内心深处的黑暗。",

In addition, Zeragonia regains her senses and can be convinced into helping the characters fight the rest of the lycanthropes and Jacoty.": "一旦完成最后一步，巢穴中的所有魔法都会停止运作，从而使杰科蒂的力量减弱，更容易被角色们打败。此外，泽拉戈尼亚也会恢复理智，并被说服帮助角色们与其他狼人和杰科蒂战斗。",

The people of Floss's Cross worked hard to provide the best food, drink, and services to the many travelers who passed through their village, and they grew accustomed to the prosperity that came with a respected reputation.

	"Unfortunately, the hamlet's success and reputation also drew some unwanted attention. An avarice seraph called Rusk and a gluttony seraph called Yort realized that by infiltrating the town, they might be able to corrupt some of the very powerful people who visited Floss's Cross regularly. The pair, along with their lesser disavowed minions, have turned the place into a ticking time bomb.": "不幸的是，小镇的成功和声誉也吸引了一些不必要的关注。一个叫拉斯克（Rusk）的贪婪蛇人和一个叫约特 （Yort）的贪吃蛇人意识到，通过潜入小镇，他们可能会腐蚀一些经常光顾弗洛丝十字镇的权贵。这两个人，连同他们那些不屑一顾的爪牙，把这个地方变成了一颗定时炸弹。",
	"They found a way to attract a caprathorn to the area. The potential devastation a caprathorn might cause gives the pair of disavowed leverage over the rich and powerful visitors to the town, and it would certainly bring powerful people to deal with it.

	"Between the magic and the innate charms of the disavowed, Hemina is muddled in her thinking. She strongly believes both Rusk and Yort are wonderful friends. Hemina remembers serving food to the powerful figure and their bodyguards, but she hasn't seen them in a few days. She assumes they, like many of the people in town, are staying hidden because of the threat of the caprathorn.": "在魔法和与生俱来的魅力之间，海米娜的思维很混乱。她坚信鲁斯克和约尔特都是很好的朋友。海米娜记得自己曾为这两位大人物和他们的保镖送过食物，但她已经好几天没见过他们了。她猜想他们和镇上的许多人一样，因为摩羯的威胁而躲了起来。",
	"The dining party consists of six wealthy travelers ((%0%)) who couldn't turn down the chance to eat a meal at one of the premiere restaurants among the elite of Etharis. Unfortunately for them, the seraphs added poison to the meal, with the plan of killing them, stealing their coin and jewelry, and burning the bodies.": "用餐的一行人包括六位富有的旅行者（（%0%）），他们无法拒绝在伊萨瑞斯精英阶层的首屈一指的餐厅用餐的机会。不幸的是，蛇人在餐点中添加了毒药，计划杀死他们，偷走他们的钱币和珠宝，然后焚尸。",
	"Not long after the characters enter the building, the diners start suffering the effects of the poison. If the characters attempt to help the diners, each needs a successful DC 10 Wisdom ((%0%)) check to save them from dying. Magic that neutralizes poison also works. If the characters attempt to intercede, the seraphs attack them.": "角色进入大楼后不久，食客们就开始受到毒药的影响。如果角色试图帮助这些食客，每个人都需要成功通过 DC 10 智慧（（%0%））检定才能使他们免于死亡。中和毒药的魔法也同样有效。如果角色试图进行干预，蛇人就会攻击他们。",
	"If the characters search the pantry, they find many ingredients of a magical, rather than a culinary, nature. On a successful DC 20 Intelligence ((%0%) or (%1%)) check, someone knows these ingredients, if ingested in the correct amounts and combinations, could cause anything from lethargy to intense pain to incapacitation to death. These ingredients are rare, and an alchemist specializing in rare ingredients and components would pay 750 gp for them.": "如果角色搜索储藏室，他们会发现许多魔法而非烹饪性质的配料。如果成功通过 DC 20 智力（(%0%) 或 (%1%)）检查，就会有人知道这些配料如果以正确的量和组合摄入，会导致从昏睡、剧痛、丧失能力到死亡的任何后果。这些成分非常稀有，专门制作稀有成分和部件的炼金术士会为此支付 750 便士。",

He also uses the statue to summon the caprathorn if the situation is dire.": "约尔特假装是镇上的居民，躲在自己家中。他知道最好不要独自挑战这些角色，所以他想方设法让这些角色陪他去一个盟友可能会帮助他的地方。如果情况危急，他还会用雕像召唤卷尾龙。",

If a battle does begin, one of them rushes to retrieve Rusk.": "八个人 (%0%)* 占领了马厩。每次只有四个人在马厩里，因为他们轮流看守他们绑架并计划勒索赎金的强人。其他四人则在该地区，一旦发生战斗，他们就会赶去帮助自己的同伙。他们的任务是确保囚犯不会逃跑，也确保没有人窥探到他们。如果战斗打响，他们中的一个就会赶去救回卢斯科。",

	"If the battle is going badly for the seraphs—which it most assuredly will at this level of play—one of the seraphs threatens the NPC if they characters do not back away. At this level, hostage situations are generally not an issue for characters, as they have magical capabilities that can bring people back to life with very little problem. If you want the hostage situation to present a true challenge, have the NPC hostage admit to the players that because of a family curse, no magic can bring them back to life once they're dead.": "如果战斗对大蛇人不利--在这个级别的游戏中肯定会出现这种情况--其中一个大蛇人就会威胁 NPC，如果他们不后退的话。在这一关卡中，挟持人质的情况对角色来说一般不是问题，因为他们拥有魔法能力，可以让人起死回生。如果想让人质事件成为真正的挑战，可以让 NPC 人质向玩家承认，由于家族诅咒，他们死后没有魔法可以复活。",

	"While the disavowed can summon the caprathorn, they cannot control it. This means that any battle involving all three sides (characters, disavowed, and caprathorn) can go in any direction. Many high-level groups could handle the battle even if the disavowed and caprathorn worked together, but regulating the action based on the success of the characters is highly recommended.": "虽然弃权者可以召唤摩羯，但他们无法控制摩羯。这意味着任何涉及三方（角色、不认主者和卷尾龙）的战斗都可以朝任何方向发展。即使不认主的人和卡普拉托恩合作，许多高级团队也能应付战斗，但强烈建议根据角色的成功来调节行动。",

	"If the characters rescue them but allow harm to come to them first, the reward is halved and the powerful figure acts much more stiffly around the characters, expecting that heroes of such power should have been able to mount a rescue more expertly than they did.": "如果角色们救了他们，却让他们先受到伤害，那么奖励就会减半，而强大的人物在角色们周围的行为也会变得更加生硬，因为他们认为拥有如此强大力量的英雄应该比他们更擅长营救。",
	"Regardless, the people of Floss's Cross are ecstatic that the characters not only eliminated the caprathorn, but also rooted out the corruption brought to the town by the disavowed. Being heroes of an area beloved by so many powerful people certainly could have its perks.": "无论如何，弗洛丝十字镇的居民们都欣喜若狂，因为他们不仅消灭了卷尾龙，还根除了不被承认的人给小镇带来的腐败。作为一个受众多权贵爱戴的地区的英雄，当然有它的好处。",

It dragged the powerful undead creature to a remote prison, far from any civilized areas that she might threaten.": "古老的精灵吸血鬼艾莉德拉尼娅（Aeilidrania）恐吓世界各地的社区，积聚力量、影响力、信息和追随者，并为自己建立了一个小型的亡灵领地。当这个吸血鬼的力量达到顶峰时，一个名叫贝尼坦特的恩比鲁斯天使突然袭击并抓住了她。它把这个强大的亡灵生物拖到了一个偏远的监狱，那里远离任何她可能威胁到的文明地区。",
	"Unable to kill Aeilidrania permanently and fearing she would simply escape if he destroyed her current form, Benitent secured the vampire in a magical dwelling on an island surrounded by an abjuration-powered moat. The vampire's many followers have scoured the world, looking for a way to rescue their absent master, but only a few have managed to find this area. They cannot, however, breach the moat and the bridge, so they hurl themselves ineffectively at the barrier, all the while trying to think of other ways to free their mistress.": "贝尼坦特无法永久杀死艾莉德拉尼娅，又担心如果他摧毁了她现在的形态，她就会逃之夭夭，于是他将吸血鬼安置在一个小岛上的魔法居所中，该居所四周环绕着一条施了咒语的护城河。吸血鬼的众多追随者遍寻世界，寻找解救不在主人的方法，但只有少数人设法找到了这里。然而，他们无法冲破护城河和桥梁，因此只能无力地向障碍物投掷，同时还在想其他办法解救女主人。",
	"Benitent is only able to keep this prison intact through the power of a mortal being. Fearing that bringing any living creature into the prison area might give the vampire someone to manipulate, the angel of Empyreus employed a blind and deaf caretaker named Habret to live on the island, taking care of pigs and living in a small house.": "贝尼坦特只有借助凡人的力量才能使这座监狱保持完整。Empyreus 的天使担心把任何生物带入监狱区会给吸血鬼提供可操纵的对象，于是雇佣了一个又瞎又聋的名叫 Habret 的看守人住在岛上，负责照顾猪，并住在一间小房子里。",
	"For her part, Aeilidrania has given up attempting to escape. She's formed a friendship with the old caretaker, sharing with him much of the knowledge and wisdom she's gathered across the many centuries of her unlife. She also has enacted plans to corrupt Benitent, tricking the single-focused angel of Empyreus into unconsciously doing her bidding even while she remains its prisoner.": "艾莉德拉尼亚则放弃了逃跑的打算。她与老看守人建立了友谊，与他分享了自己几个世纪以来收集的许多知识和智慧。她还制定了腐蚀贝尼坦特的计划，诱使这个只专注于 Empyreus 的天使不自觉地听从她的命令，即使她仍然是它的囚犯。",

	"A world-threatening problem is rapidly hurtling toward the characters, and one piece of information they need to fight it rests firmly in the twisted but brilliant mind of the elven vampire Aeilidrania. After some research and investigation, they hear rumors that the vampire they seek lives in a secluded region far from any civilized areas. Whether or not they learn of the vampire's imprisonment by Benitent, the angel of Empyreus, depends on how much research they undertake and how many resources they use. With no other means of securing the information they need to deal with the incredible threat, the characters are forced to seek out Aeilidrania.": "一个威胁世界的问题正迅速向主人公们逼近，而他们需要的一个信息就牢牢地掌握在精灵吸血鬼艾莉德拉尼亚扭曲而又聪明的头脑中。经过一番研究和调查，他们听到传言说，他们要找的吸血鬼生活在一个远离文明地区的偏僻地区。他们能否得知吸血鬼被 Empyreus 的天使 Benitent 监禁的消息，取决于他们进行了多少研究，使用了多少资源。由于没有其他办法获得应对巨大威胁所需的信息，他们不得不寻找艾莉德拉尼亚。",

	"If you're interested in giving the characters a way to get the information without having to kill everything on the island, here is an option: Since Aeilidrania does not see Habret as a threat, the vampire might have told the old man precisely the information that the characters are looking for. Habret would not have remembered the exact details, but by using magic, the characters might be able to retrieve that information.": "如果你有兴趣让人物有办法获得信息，而不必杀死岛上的一切，这里有一个选择： 既然艾莉德拉尼亚不把哈布雷特当做威胁，那么吸血鬼可能已经把角色们正在寻找的信息准确地告诉了老人。哈布雷特不可能记得确切的细节，但通过使用魔法，角色们也许可以找回这些信息。",

	"The daemonic skull that infuses Gegazol with extra abilities has a sentience of its own, and it has plans. If Gegazol can rule the northern realms of Etharis, she can certainly rule the entirety of this world—and possibly other worlds as well.

All that narrative power comes when we, as game masters, don't simply hand the characters the answers to their problems.": "也许炼金术士本身也面临着来自其他敌人的危险，所以她需要角色们花时间解决她的问题，然后她才能制作出必要的毒素。也许当地的向导是敌人的间谍，他不但没有带他们找到巢穴，反而把角色引入了歧途。时间因素也可能迫使人物做出艰难的决定。作为游戏的主人，我们不能简单地把问题的答案交给角色，而是要让他们感受到叙事的力量。",

A skilled weaponsmith with the necessary tools and training in arcane crafting is many times more valuable than any single magic weapon she could produce.": "在一个所有魔法物品和问题答案都必须通过努力才能获得和制作的环境中，NPC 在活动中的作用会更大。一个拥有必要工具和奥术制作培训的熟练武器匠的价值要比她能制作的任何一件魔法武器高出许多倍。",
	"This heightens the characters (and their players) appreciation for, and attention to, the NPCs they encounter. NPCs are no longer cardboard cutouts that sit idly by, waiting for rescue from danger, while the heroes go about their business. The lives of these NPCs are much more important to the characters, and to the unfolding narrative of the campaign, when they have important information and assistance to offer.": "这将提高角色（及其玩家）对所遇到的 NPC 的欣赏和关注。当英雄们忙着自己的事情时，NPC 不再是袖手旁观、等待救援的纸板人。当这些 NPC 能提供重要信息和帮助时，他们的生命对角色和活动的叙事发展就会变得更加重要。",
	"NPCs, when they gain this increased importance in the success of the characters, enrich the campaign's setting. A calculating villain whose weak point can be exploited by the creations of an expert alchemist is much more likely to target the alchemist than the characters—and this brings a new dynamic to a campaign.": "当 NPC 在角色成功中的重要性增加时，他们就会丰富活动的背景。一个老谋深算的反派，如果他的弱点可以被炼金术士的作品所利用，那么他就更有可能把目标对准炼金术士，而不是人物--这就为战役带来了新的活力。",
	"The salvage rules for monsters includes not just what can be taken from the monsters; what can be crafted with those items is also stated.": "怪物的打捞规则不仅包括可以从怪物身上打捞什么，还说明了这些物品可以制作什么。",
	"Crafting these items takes into account four elements, in addition to the salvaged components:": "制作这些物品时，除了要考虑残余部件外，还要考虑四个要素：",
	"Crafting time": "制作时间",
	"Necessary proficiencies or spells": "必要的能力或法术",
	"Ability checks": "能力检查",
	"Other components": "其他组件",
	"Each of these elements is described in greater detail below. Remember: these elements are suggestions. Any or all of them can be changed to best fit your campaign.": "下文将详细介绍其中的每一个要素。请记住：这些要素只是建议。可以对其中任何一项或全部进行修改，以最适合您的活动。",
	"The monsters threatening the area may seem much more powerful than the characters can handle, yet they have no choice but to try.": "威胁该地区的怪物似乎比角色所能对付的要强大得多，但他们别无选择，只能尝试。",
	"The necessary time for item crafting is based on the type of item and its rarity. Items like weapons, armor, or clothing generally take longer than potions. However, powerful magic also adds complexity—and therefore time—to the crafting period. A simple potion might only take a few hours, while the most powerful arcane implement takes several days, weeks, or even months of constant work.": "物品制作所需的时间取决于物品的类型和稀有程度。武器、盔甲或衣服等物品一般比药剂花费的时间长。然而，强大的魔法也会增加制作时间的复杂性和时间。简单的药剂可能只需要几个小时，而最强大的奥术道具则需要几天、几周甚至几个月的持续工作。",
	"The length of time listed for crafting items from salvage passes whether the item is created successfully or not. The time assumes that the crafters work 16-hour days, and then take the mandatory 8 hours of a long rest.": "无论物品是否制作成功，所列的利用打捞物制作物品的时间长度都是有效的。该时间假定制作者每天工作 16 小时，然后必须休息 8 小时。",
	"Remember that during the time spent crafting, the crafters must still eat, rest, and take care of themselves. This might incur expenses renting space, buying food, etc. Those who aren't crafting can, of course, take steps to provide those resources.": "请记住，在手工制作期间，手工制作者还必须吃饭、休息和照顾自己。这可能会产生租用空间、购买食物等费用。当然，不从事手工制作的人也可以采取措施提供这些资源。",
	"If crafting is going to play an important role in your campaign, providing characters (or even NPCs) with rules-based abilities to perform crafting might be just as valuable as combat-based abilities. For example, offering feats like the ones below might be valuable:": "如果手工制作将在你的战役中扮演重要角色，那么为角色（甚至 NPC）提供基于规则的手工制作能力可能与基于战斗的能力一样有价值。例如，提供像下面这样的特技可能就很有价值：",
	"You've trained in crafting items using a skill or tool that you're proficient with, and the steps in crafting have become second nature to you. You gain the following benefits:": "您已经使用自己精通的技能或工具进行过物品制作训练，制作步骤已经成为您的第二天性。您将获得以下好处：",
	"The time it takes to create an item using your proficient skills or tools is halved.": "使用您精通的技能或工具制作一件物品所需的时间减半。",
	"If you fail to successfully craft the item and would lose the components, you retain the components instead.": "如果您未能成功制作该物品，会丢失组件，但您会保留组件。",
	"You've trained in crafting items using a skill or tool that you're proficient with, and your creations are known for being well made and reliable. You gain the following benefits:": "您曾接受过使用您精通的技能或工具制作物品的训练，您的作品以制作精良、质量可靠而著称。您将获得以下好处：",
	"You make all ability checks for crafting with advantage.": "您可以以优势进行所有手工制作的能力检定。",
	"Anyone assisting you in crafting an item gains advantage on their ability checks for crafting.": "任何协助您制作物品的人都会在他们的制作能力检定中获得优势。",
	"If you fail to successfully craft the item, the amount of time it took to complete the process is halved.": "如果您未能成功制作该物品，则完成该过程所需的时间将减半。",
	"The time assumes that the crafters work 16-hour days...": "时间假定手工艺者每天工作 16 小时...",
	"Crafting items sometimes requires a character or NPC with a certain proficiency to take part in the crafting. A person proficient with weaponsmith's tools must create the sword or mace if a magical weapon is being crafted. This proficiency is separate from the ability check that must be successfully made to craft the item.": "制作物品有时需要具有一定熟练程度的角色或 NPC 参与。如果制作的是魔法武器，则必须由精通武器匠工具的人制作剑或锏。该熟练度与制作物品时必须成功进行的能力检定是分开的。",
	"For example, creating (%0%) from a xakalonus requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence ((%1%)) check by a proficient alchemist. If a single person meets both conditions (proficient with alchemist's supplies (%2%) proficient in the (%3%) skill), they can craft the oil by themselves. However, two people can also work together if each is proficient in only one of the necessary skills or tools. In this case, they must each spend the entire time required for crafting.": "例如，精通炼金术的人需要成功通过 DC 15 的智力（（%1%））检定才能用夏卡龙制造（%0%）。如果一个人同时满足这两个条件（精通炼金术士用品 (%2%) 精通 (%3%) 技能），就可以独自制作精油。不过，如果两个人都只精通一种必要的技能或工具，也可以一起工作。在这种情况下，他们必须各自花费制作所需的全部时间。",
	"The ability check associated with a crafting should be made at the end of the crafting period. If the check is a success, the item is successful crafted. On a failure, the item is not crafted successful, and all the components that went into the crafting are consumed (unless otherwise stated).": "与制作相关的能力检查应在制作期结束时进行。如果检查成功，则物品制作成功。如果失败，则物品制作不成功，制作过程中的所有组件都会消耗掉（除非另有说明）。",
	"Only people who take part in the entire process, and who are proficient in the skill called for, can attempt this check. If multiple people involved are proficient with the skill, they can roll individually, or they can assist someone else, giving them advantage on the check.": "只有参与整个过程并精通所需技能的人才能尝试此检查。如果多人都精通该技能，他们可以单独掷骰子，也可以协助其他人，这样他们就能在检查中获得优势。",
	"Magic that provides bonuses for a limited time—such as (%0%)—cannot be used to affect the ability check unless it is active for the entirety of the crafting process.": "在有限时间内提供奖励的魔法（例如 (%0%)）不能用来影响能力检定，除非它在整个制作过程中都处于激活状态。",
	"In some cases, rather than calling for a certain skill or ability check, the crafting of an item requires repeated casting of a particular spell. In these cases, someone must be available and willing to take part in the process for at least 1 hour of the day that the crafting takes place. This spell might be provided from a scroll, magic item, NPC, or some other source. Spells provided by a source other than a character might require payment, which could be in the form of coin, favors, or whatever else you can imagine that makes for a memorable story.": "在某些情况下，制作一件物品不需要某种技能或能力检定，而是需要重复施放特定的咒语。在这种情况下，必须有人在制作当天的至少一个小时内有空并愿意参与制作过程。该咒语可能由卷轴、魔法物品、NPC 或其他来源提供。由角色以外的来源提供的法术可能需要报酬，报酬的形式可以是金币、恩惠或其他任何你能想象到的令人难忘的故事。",
	"Some players may bristle at a system where one failed check might have great repercussions in terms of time and components lost. If this is the case, a graduated failure system like the one below can take away some of the sting of failure.": "有些玩家可能会对这样的系统感到不满，因为一次失败的检查可能会在时间和部件损失方面造成巨大影响。如果是这种情况，像下面这样的分级失败系统可以消除一些失败的痛苦。",
	"1-3 lower than DC": "比直流电低 1-3",
	"(%0%): No components are lost, and only half the time of crafting is spent.": "(%0%): 不会丢失任何组件，只需花费一半的制作时间。",
	"4-6 lower than DC": "比直流电低 4-6",
	"(%0%): Half the components are lost, and 75% of the time are spent.": "(%0%): 损失一半的元件，花费 75% 的时间。",
	"7-9 lower than DC": "比 DC 低 7-9",
	"(%0%): All components and time is lost.": "(%0%): 丢失所有组件和时间。",
	"10+ lower than DC": "比 DC 低 10+",
	"(%0%): All components and time are lost, and all participants gain 2 levels of (%1%) (or alternative arcane mishap occurs).": "(%0%): 所有组件和时间都会丢失，所有参与者都会获得 2 级 (%1%) （或发生其他奥术意外）。",
	"The following magic items can be crafted from salvage taken from monsters found in various Grim Hollow Lairs. The process for creating them is detailed in the salvage section of the monster entry.": "以下魔法物品可以用从各种狰狞巢穴中发现的怪物身上打捞的残骸制作。制作过程详见怪物条目的残骸部分。",
	"You can, of course, simply present these items to your players as treasure taken from enemies—or even gifted or sold by NPCs or other elements of your game. However, presenting the items rather than encouraging the players (or their NPC associates) to craft them takes away from the objective of showing how valuable skills and proficiencies are in Etharis.": "当然，您也可以简单地将这些物品作为从敌人身上夺取的宝物展示给玩家，甚至可以由 NPC 或游戏中的其他元素赠送或出售。但是，只展示这些物品而不鼓励玩家（或他们的 NPC 同伴）制作这些物品，就会偏离展示技能和熟练程度在 Etharis 中的价值的目的。",
	"Potion, rare": "稀有药水",
	"This substance is created by distilling the jelly that encases the brain of a (%0%). As an action, you can coat one weapon or 20 pieces of ammunition with the substance.": "这种物质是通过蒸馏包裹（%0%）大脑的果冻而产生的。作为一个动作，你可以给一件武器或 20 件弹药涂上这种物质。",
	"If the coated objects are not magical, for the next minute, your attacks with the coated weapon or ammunition gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.": "如果涂有涂层的物品不是魔法物品，在接下来的一分钟内，你使用涂有涂层的武器或弹药进行攻击时，攻击和伤害卷轴会获得 +2 的加成。",
	"If the coated objects are magical, the oil does not affect attack or damage rolls with them. However, your attacks against the hraptnon can fully damage that creature for one minute.": "如果涂有魔法的物体，油不会影响对它们的攻击或伤害卷轴。但是，您对 Hraptnon 的攻击可以在一分钟内对该生物造成完全伤害。",
	"Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)": "盔甲（钢板），非常稀有（需要调试）",
	"This armor, fashioned from the body of an (%0%), gleams brightly in direct sunlight. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, you have resistance to fire and radiant damage.": "这件铠甲由 (%0%) 尸体制成，在阳光直射下熠熠生辉。穿戴此盔甲时，您的 AC 值会获得 +1。此外，您还能抵抗火焰和辐射伤害。",
	"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)": "魔法物品，稀有（需要施法者调谐）",
	"This coat made of the severed tongues of a (%0%)'s victims provides a +1 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Charisma ((%1%)) checks.": "这件由 (%0%) 受害者割下的舌头制成的外衣会为你的 AC 值带来 +1的加成，并且你在魅力 (%1%) 检查中占有优势。",
	"Additionally, as a bonus action three times per day, you can activate the magic of the cloak. If you do, the next spell you cast before the start of your next turn can be cast without any somatic or verbal components.": "此外，作为每天三次的额外行动，您可以激活斗篷的魔力。如果您这样做了，在下一回合开始前，您施放的下一个咒语可以不带任何躯体或语言成分。",
	"Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)": "盔甲（铆钉皮革），稀有（需要调试）",
	"While wearing this armor, you have resistance to radiant damage. Each time a creature makes a melee attack against you, it takes 3 piercing damage. A creature can choose to make an attack with disadvantage to avoid this damage.": "穿戴此盔甲时，您对辐射伤害具有抗性。每次生物对你发动近战攻击时，都会受到 3 次穿刺伤害。生物可以选择以劣势攻击来避免此伤害。",
	"Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)": "奇妙物品，稀有（需要调试）",
	"While wearing this cloak made from the skin of 20 (%0%), you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, when you fall while wearing this cloak, you descend 18 metre per round and take no damage from falling.": "当你穿上这件由 20 (%0%) 的皮肤制成的斗篷时，你会获得 AC 值+1 的加成。此外，当你穿上这件斗篷坠落时，每回合可下降 18 米，并且不会受到任何伤害。",
	"Potion (poison), very rare": "药水（毒药），非常稀有",
	"This terrible venom is extracted and distilled from the deadly (%0%). It can be delivered via ingestion or a wound. A creature exposed to the venom must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 36 ((%1%)) poison damage and be (%2%) for 1 minute.

	"lycan weapons": "狼人武器",
	"Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with (%0%) cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.": "此外，在成功攻击狼人时，目标会被强制变回人类形态，除非 DC 10 的魅力蓄力成功。此外，对吸血鬼造成的 (%0%) 伤害在该生物短暂休息前无法恢复。",
