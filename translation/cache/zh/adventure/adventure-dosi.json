In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate.

	"According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)": "根据传说，在世界诞生的最初几天，有两个龙家族诞生了。巴哈姆特，高贵的白金龙，制造了金属龙--金、银、铜、黄铜和铜。残忍的五头龙提亚马特制造了彩色的龙--红色、蓝色、绿色、黑色和白色。金属龙和彩色龙有一种共同的敌意，这种敌意源于巴哈姆特和提亚马特之间的仇恨（巴哈姆特在《被遗忘的世界》中通常被称为金属龙之王，而提亚马特是彩色龙的女王。在其他世界中，他们有不同的名字，而且像所有的神一样，他们是超越性别的。）",
	"The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.": "龙之息的起源就源于这种敌意。几百年前，一条名叫沙鲁斯的喷火红龙在剑海岸上下肆虐。三条金属龙联合起来与沙鲁斯战斗，并将她囚禁在海底，相信海水可以熄灭她的火，让她永远被束缚。但传说中，沙鲁斯的怒火引起了海底火山活动，形成了风暴残骸岛。",
	"In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.": "在所有的可能性中，沙鲁斯早就死了，被埋在岛的下面，但半透明的龙低声说，她仍然活着，并且有一天会从她的监狱里出来。有一个事实是不可否认的：这样一条古老的龙所体现的强大魔法在风暴残骸岛上留下了永久的印记。几个世纪以来，这种魔法将其他龙吸引到岛上，使它成为色龙和金属龙之间冲突的一个反复的战场。其中有几条龙死在了那里，每条龙都留下了精神上的伤痕，造成了不可预知的魔法效果。",
	"A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to harness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named (%0%) pleaded with him to abandon his schemes.
