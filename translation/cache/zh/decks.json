They have recently taken over Skullport, a subterranean town connected to Undermountain.": "一个很久以前就被赶出水底深渊的盗贼公会仍潜伏在地下深山，等待并谋划着夺回这座城市的权力。这些恶棍让诚实的人们不敢冒险进入下水道。他们最近接管了骷髅港，一个与幽暗山相连的地下城镇。",
	"The Mad Mage of Undermountain has destroyed himself or been destroyed many times, but his demise is always short-lived. Folk say the dungeon cannot exist without him, and so it magically re-creates the archmage whenever he meets his end within its crumbling halls. Each time Halaster returns, less of his sanity remains.": "地底山的疯狂法师曾多次自我毁灭或被毁灭，但他的死亡总是很短暂。民间传说，地牢不能没有他，所以每当大法师在破败的大厅里遭遇灭顶之灾时，地牢就会神奇地再造一个大法师。每次哈拉斯特回来，他的理智都会减少。",
	"The Shadowdusks were a Waterdavian noble family whose quest for political supremacy ended centuries ago after Shadowdusk wizards opened portals to the Far Realm. Twisted by madness and driven from their home, they sought assistance from Halaster and sank into the depths of Undermountain, never to be seen again—yet vestiges of the noble house undoubtedly remain.": "暗影达斯克家族是水之达维亚的贵族，几个世纪前，暗影黄昏巫师打开了通往远界的入口，结束了他们对政治霸权的追求。他们被疯狂所扭曲，被赶出了自己的家园，向哈拉斯特寻求帮助，沉入了幽暗山的深处，再也没有出现过--但毫无疑问，这个贵族家族的遗迹依然存在。",
	"Halaster brought seven apprentices with him to Undermountain. One of them, Nester, became a lich using spells and methods of his own devising. But his process was flawed, and over time Nester's phylactery and body disintegrated until only his floating skull and skeletal arms remained. Driven mad by his failure to achieve true lichdom, Nester continues to haunt Undermountain in this weakened form.": "哈拉斯特带着七个学徒来到了地下之山。其中一个叫内斯特，他用自己设计的咒语和方法变成了巫师。但他的过程有缺陷，随着时间的推移，内斯特的法器和身体逐渐解体，最后只剩下漂浮的头骨和骷髅手臂。由于未能成为真正的巫师，内斯特被逼疯了，以这种虚弱的形态继续在地下山上出没。",

Others have searched for it below Waterdeep, but no one has found it and lived to tell the tale.": "利剑之海曾出现过许多海盗船，其中最著名的莫过于 (%0%)。这艘船可以在波涛之下和空中穿梭。很多年没人见过它了。也许它沉没了，或者在夜空的星辰漩涡中迷失了方向，但占卜法术显示它进入了冥山。其他人也曾在水底寻找过它，但没有人找到它并活着讲述这个故事。",
	"Rumor has it that a wizards' academy has opened on one of Undermountain's levels. It's not known who runs this academy—perhaps one of Halaster's apprentices or the Mad Mage himself—but many mages have been drawn down to it. What wizard wouldn't want to glimpse the powerful magic gathering dust in the depths of Undermountain?": "有传言说，冥山的某一层开设了一所巫师学院。不知道是谁开办了这所学院--也许是哈拉斯特的学徒，也许是疯法师本人--但许多法师都被吸引到了这里。哪个魔法师不想一睹地下深山中尘封的强大魔法呢？",
	"Skullport overlooks the Sargauth River, a watery thoroughfare that cuts through the third level of Undermountain. Pirates once used the subterranean settlement as a trade port, but now it's a monster-infested haunt where spies and assassins hone their craft. Beware the fortress overlooking the river! Its garrison is commanded by an evil knight with a wyvern mount.": "骷髅港俯瞰着萨尔高特河，这是一条穿过地下第三层的水上通道。海盗们曾经把这个地下定居点当作贸易港口，但现在这里却成了怪物出没的地方，间谍和刺客们在这里磨练自己的技艺。小心俯瞰河流的堡垒！这里的守军由一位拥有狼人坐骑的邪恶骑士指挥。",
	"Deep within Undermountain is a vast cavern containing a giant stalagmite that has been hollowed out to serve as a wizard's tower, perhaps even a refuge for the Mad Mage himself. The tower is guarded by stone constructs. No one knows what dwells inside. Not far from this tower lurks a most peculiar creature: a giant snail with a shell of pure gold.": "地下山深处有一个巨大的洞穴，里面有一根巨大的石笋，石笋被挖空后用作巫师塔，甚至可能是疯法师本人的避难所。这座塔由石头建筑守卫着。没人知道里面住着什么。在离这座塔不远的地方，潜伏着一种最奇特的生物：一只有着纯金外壳的巨型蜗牛。",
	"Secret temples exist in great numbers in Undermountain, particularly those of evil gods not welcomed in the city above.

Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the fiendish mastermind behind many of these bloody conflicts.": "地下城里存在着大量的秘密神庙，尤其是那些不受上层城市欢迎的邪神的神庙。这些神灵卑鄙的仆人们在黑暗地宫中为争夺至高无上的地位而进行着无休止的战争。蜘蛛魔后洛尔斯是许多血腥冲突的幕后黑手。",
	"Trobriand was one of Halaster's most promising and demented apprentices. Fascinated by machines, he carved out a level of the Mad Mage's dungeon for himself and set to work building an army of constructs there. It is said that Trobriand controls his creations with a metal ring, and that he crafted similar rings of lesser power for his apprentices, to protect them in the event that his constructs went insane.": "特罗布里安德是哈拉斯特最有前途的癫狂学徒之一。他对机器非常着迷，在疯狂法师的地牢中为自己开辟了一层，并开始在那里建造一支建筑大军。据说，特罗布里安德用一个金属环控制着他的作品，他还为他的学徒们制作了威力较小的类似金属环，以便在他的作品发疯时保护他们。",
	"The River of the Depths connects the fourth and fifth levels of Undermountain, skirting the edges of vast caverns filled with trees, shrubs, birds, other animals, and sunlight. An entire forest, as real as any found on the surface, waits to be explored, but an archdruid protects it. And explorers traveling downriver have seen a huge green dragon as well, perched on a tower near a bridge that spans the river.": "深渊之河连接着地底之山的第四层和第五层，绕过长满树木、灌木、鸟类、其他动物和阳光的巨大洞穴的边缘。整个森林和地面上的森林一样真实，等待着人们去探索，但一位大德鲁伊保护着它。顺流而下的探险者还看到了一条巨大的绿龙，它栖息在横跨河流的一座桥附近的高塔上。",
	"Part of Undermountain was carved out by the drow. Muiral, said to be a former bodyguard and apprentice of Halaster's, claims this domain and hunts trespass- ers for sport. These halls are littered with the bones of the slaughtered. Even the dark elves speak of Muiral in hushed tones. Anyone who can terrify the drow should be avoided at all costs.": "地底之山的一部分是由鸦人开辟出来的。据说穆伊拉尔曾是哈拉斯特的保镖和学徒，他声称拥有这片领地，并以狩猎擅闯者为乐。这些大厅里到处都是被屠杀者的尸骨。就连黑暗精灵说起穆伊拉尔也是低声下气。任何能让乌鸦人恐惧的人，都应该不惜一切代价避开。",
