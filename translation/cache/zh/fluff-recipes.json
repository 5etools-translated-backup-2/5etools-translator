	"No, it isn't made from orcs—but for orcs. Half-orcs find this delectable snack quite to their taste, as do the goliaths of Eberron and a few game humans and halflings. It is said that a half-orc named Mazmorras was the first to discover this pungent recipe for cured pork strips, which you can practically taste from twenty yards away. Sometimes called \"the Pork of Gruumsh,\" orcs flavor it with black pepper and garlic; a halfling might instead smooth off the edge with some maple syrup. Experienced adventuring parties venturing into orc lands know that dropping a bundle of bacon can throw pursuers off their trail, and orcs have even been known to barter with humans who carry it. For best results, try using Thayan Doomvault Swine Run pork—it has the right potency.": "不，它不是由兽人制作的，而是为兽人制作的。半兽人发现这种美味的小吃很合他们的口味，Eberron的巨人和一些游戏中的人类和半兽人也是如此。据说，一个名叫马兹莫拉斯（Mazmorras）的半兽人是第一个发现这种腌制猪肉条的辛辣配方的人，你几乎可以在20码之外品尝到它。有时被称为 \"格鲁姆什的猪肉\"，兽人用黑胡椒和大蒜调味；而半兽人可能会用一些枫糖浆来抹去边缘。有经验的冒险者在兽人的土地上冒险时知道，扔下一捆培根可以让追兵失去踪迹，而兽人甚至还知道与携带培根的人类进行交换。为了获得最佳效果，请尝试使用塔扬-杜姆瓦特（Tayan Doomvault）的猪跑肉--它有适当的效力。",
	"The Dessarin Valley region of Faerûn offers far more than fertile land and majestic sunsets (and wandering monsters). It's also home to some of the finest cattle farming in all Toril. This succulent, slow-cooked beef chuck roast, inspired by a popular regional recipe that originated with the Oglyntyr family in the village of Amphail, is prepared with cider, pear, and ginger—all of which help to activate the full flavor of the meat. The ginger offers the dish a pleasing warmth and an unexpected nuance, more than an overt gingery flavor, while the fermented hard pear cider provides a touch of residual sweetness, albeit dry and earthy. Don't fret, if you can't track down hard pear cider (sometimes called \"perry\"), then apple will do just fine! Roasted sweet potatoes or winter squash make a savory accompaniment and taste wonderful with a ladle or two of sweet au jus.": "法鲁恩的德萨林山谷地区提供的远不止是肥沃的土地和雄伟的日落（以及游荡的怪物）。它也是整个托里尔最好的养牛场的所在地。这道肉质鲜美的慢火烤牛肉，灵感来自于安普海尔村奥甘特尔家族的一个流行的地区食谱，用苹果酒、梨和生姜烹制，所有这些都有助于激活肉的全部味道。姜为这道菜提供了令人愉悦的温暖和意想不到的细微差别，而不是公开的姜味，而发酵的硬梨苹果酒提供了一丝残留的甜味，尽管是干的和土的。不要着急，如果你找不到硬梨苹果酒（有时称为 \"佩里\"），那么苹果也可以。烤红薯或冬瓜是一种美味的佐料，配上一两勺甜味汁，味道非常好。",

However, this recipe is rumored to be the personal one of Arkhan the Cruel, notorious disciple of the five-headed dragon goddess, Tiamat, and thus worthy of inclusion. You won't catch this ferocious and cunning Oathbreaker Paladin eating anything less than the finest halfling flesh in his chili, but the spices work wonderfully with any meat substitute you choose—in this instance, spicy ground turkey, or abyssal chicken, which is simmered for hours with kidney beans, allspice, cloves, cayenne, and a Vecna's handful of cocoa powder.

These traditional sausages are sheet pan–baked with succulent tomatoes that soak up the juices and practically polymorph into a meat themselves.

They are known for extreme proficiency in combat, but mediocrity (or less) in just about everything else. Although several orc elders live among Minmax people serving as healers, shamans, and storytellers, the clan, led by the fearsome and wise Kalatuur Minmax, has embraced an atypical approach to food and politics. Similarly, their palate ranges greatly, from subtler human fare such as fish, cheese, and bread to the orcish desire for big-game meat.

But even aasimar are half-human, and their need for mortal sustenance is why many believe the bread recipe common in the Twin Paradises is ultimately aasimar in origin. This spiced bread, served in thick slices, is made from grains imbued with grated carrots and rich chunks of almond.

	"Crafted from a secret Evermeet recipe and aged for hundreds of years, a sip of this splendid elven concoction is \"a taste of the higher planes themselves.\" Superlatives aside, in the culinary realm, it is undeniably the beverage by which all others are measured. Smooth and aromatic, this extraordinary elixir blankets the palate with powerful notes of clover honey and a mélange of elven fruits and grains that are so rare they don't even have a name in the common language. Rumored to use ingredients and techniques similar to feywine, this pricey draught is only available on the Isle of Evermeet in the Trackless Sea west of Faerûn or in Aurora's Catalogue by hand keg or bottle.

	"There is a parallel plane to the \"Prime\" (the one that contains all known worlds of the multiverse) known as the Feywild, or the Plane of Faerie, from which sylvan creatures such as pixies, satyrs, unicorns, dryads, and the like originated. It was in this mirror realm, bathed in eternal twilight and ethereal luminescence, that all elven-kind was birthed from swirling, limitless magic, including the eladrin—elves with an unfathomably deep connection to the seasons. These elves, who still call the fey dimension home, boast a highly intuitive link with nature and are able to craft incredible meals with near-perfect combinations of ingredients. One dish, known as Feywild eggs, is a delightful presentation of creamed, herbed, and fluffed eggs, completed over even heat for a golden crisp finish. Some have claimed this simple recipe descended from the leShay, an immortal breed of fey \"elves\" with incredible, godlike powers. Thankfully, you don't need to visit the Feywild to try these eggs.

Some reject their unholy origins outright, but many proudly live in harmony with it, open to exploring all aspects of their unique traits. This open-minded approach has yielded a bold, unfettered diet that is often unapproachable and sometimes dangerous to the uninitiated. One dish they have a knack for is fire-spiced abyssal chicken (a bird-like fiend native to the Abyss and Avernus with a taste similar to fatty chicken), or fire-spiced anything for that matter since their natural resistance to heat has granted them an enhanced ability to handle spice as well.

The arms and legs of the gingerbread man are ringed with icing, but the body is covered in a protective armor of chopped nuts and raisins.

While quaint country cottages connected by narrow footpaths crowd the surface, the true action is in their generous cellars, which can extend as many as three stories below the ground. Linked by tunnels that serve as underground thoroughfares, gnome residents run shoppes, inns, and taprooms out of these cozy, hearth-lit subterranean spaces. It's here you'll find the town's culinary specialty: Hardbuckler stew.

A thick handmade crust and a flaky, buttery top blanket a tart and tasty rose apple (nearly any apple suffices, season pending, of course) and blackberry filling with spiced ground accents.

Diminutive, smoked pork-and-beef bangers are snugly rolled up into salty dough \"bedrolls\" until only their \"heads\" are poking out. The expert maneuver is to brush these little snacks with a thin egg wash before popping them in the oven, ensuring a glossy shine and a boost of color.

Bread, buttered on the outside, is layered with strips of cheese, sprinkled with seasoning, and pan-fried, before being sliced into strips, or \"dippers,\" for soup dunking. The recipe itself is quite simple (and really just an excuse to eat more cheese)! Sometimes served spicy, these sandwiches are often dashed with dill, nutmeg, basil, or the like, depending on the mood of the chef. The same goes for the accompanying soup, commonly a chunky tomato but occasionally a smooth red pepper puree. It's always served warm, more as a sort of dipping sauce that can be guzzled once the cheeses have disappeared. One of the simplest midday recipes in the halfling repertoire, melted cheeses have also been heavily adopted by humans across the land, with the dish adorning countless tavern menus.": "半身人不仅了解他们的奶酪，他们还拥有无数种准备奶酪的方法。面包外面涂上黄油，上面铺上奶酪条，撒上调料，然后煎一下，再切成条状，或者叫 \"蘸酱\"，用来灌汤。食谱本身很简单（实际上只是一个吃更多奶酪的借口）! 这些三明治有时会有辣味，通常会加入莳萝、肉豆蔻、罗勒或类似的东西，这取决于厨师的心情。配套的汤也是如此，通常是大块的西红柿，但偶尔也有光滑的红辣椒泥。它总是热着喝，更多的是作为一种蘸酱，一旦奶酪消失，就可以大口大口地喝。作为半身人食谱中最简单的午间食谱之一，融化的奶酪也被各地的人类大量采用，这道菜成为无数酒馆菜单的装饰。",
	"The Miner's Pie, sometimes referred to as a \"shepherd's pie\" by humans and halflings, is a truly hearty one-stop meal for the tireless dwarf in all of us. Ground beef (or lamb or venison), sweet corn, peas, onions, and leeks are crusted by a potato mash topped with cheese. This is one of the few dwarven dishes readily served at inns across Faerûn, particularly those of the North and Heartlands, likely because the human variant borrows much from this dwarven classic.": "矿工馅饼，有时被人类和半身人称为 \"牧羊人馅饼\"，对于我们所有人中不知疲倦的侏儒来说，这是真正丰盛的一站式膳食。碎牛肉（或羊肉或鹿肉）、甜玉米、豌豆、洋葱和韭菜被土豆泥包裹着，上面还有奶酪。这是整个法鲁恩的旅馆中为数不多的矮人菜肴之一，特别是那些北方和心脏地带的旅馆，可能是因为人类的变体在很大程度上借鉴了这个矮人的经典。",
	"Originated in the mythical elven isle of Evermeet but popularized by adventurous expatriates along the Sword Coast and its scattered archipelago, this creamy fish rice dish requires a patient chef...but it's well worth the wait! Short-grain rice (which yields a stickier, compact texture), along with a medley of ocean \"fruits,\" including shrimp and scallops, is slow cooked in a rich seafood broth until it reaches a smooth, velvety consistency. Butter, onion, saffron, elven dry white wine, and olive oil all intermingle and do their part in activating the dreamy maritime flavors. Some elven chefs of old would finish the dish with a swirl of mascarpone.": "这道奶油鱼饭起源于神话中的精灵岛Evermeet，但在剑海岸及其分散的群岛上被富有冒险精神的侨民所推广，这道菜需要一个有耐心的厨师......但它非常值得等待 短粒米（产生更粘稠、更紧凑的质地），以及各种海洋 \"水果\"，包括虾和扇贝，在丰富的海鲜汤中慢煮，直到达到光滑、天鹅绒般的稠度。黄油、洋葱、藏红花、精灵族的干白葡萄酒和橄榄油都交织在一起，为激活梦幻般的海洋风味尽一份力量。一些古老的精灵厨师会在这道菜的最后加上一圈马斯卡彭奶酪。",
	"When the hearth fire dims in the Underdark, the drow are known to reach for their kettles—not to make any herbal tea, but instead an after-dinner broth of simmering mushrooms. If they can find them, the drow prefer matsutake, though shiitake or maitake will do in a pinch. They place the sliced mushrooms into a clear broth seasoned with dried kelp, sometimes with a splash of fish stock or soy sauce and alcohol, and heat it in a teakettle. From this, they pour small cups of the fragrant tea to imbibe slowly until the mushrooms cook to perfection, at which point they are eaten with a fine skewer.": "当暗黑世界的炉火变暗时，众所周知，乌鸦会伸手去拿水壶--不是为了做任何草药茶，而是为了做饭后的煨蘑菇汤。如果他们能找到，乌鸦更喜欢松茸，尽管香菇或平菇在紧要关头也能做到。他们把切好的蘑菇放入用干海带调味的清汤中，有时加入鱼汤或酱油和酒精，并在茶壶中加热。他们从中倒出一小杯芳香的茶，慢慢地喝，直到蘑菇煮得很熟，这时就用一根细串来吃。",
	"Dwarves are widely renowned for their \"unsweet tooth,\" but that doesn't deny them good taste, as evidenced by the southern Faerûnian gold dwarves' affinity for orange and persimmon mountain duck. The uniquely hot-and-tart sauce brightens the succulent gamey meat and yields a divine duck-skin treat. Perhaps years of living near humans wore them down or broadened their palate, but it is said modern dwarves have actually come to blows over the coveted crispy skin alone!

	"This famous side dish, comprising chopped potatoes, served spiced and fried, is derived from the personal recipe of Otik Sandath, proprietor and chef of the Inn of the Last Home, located in a remote Krynn city called Solace in Ansalon. Otik's personal blend of garlic, paprika, pepper, cayenne, and a sizeable scoop of local salted butter is often emulated but tough to beat; however, the recipe featured below is widely thought to be the closest that one can come to the feeling of sitting atop the famed vallenwood tree tavern with one of his homebrewed dark ales in hand. These potatoes pair well with any braised meats on the menu or with eggs as a day starter.": "这道著名的配菜由切碎的土豆组成，以香料和油炸的方式食用，源自奥蒂克-桑达斯的个人食谱，他是位于安萨隆一个叫索拉斯的偏远克莱恩城市的老板和厨师。欧提克个人对大蒜、辣椒、胡椒、卡宴和一大勺当地咸黄油的混合配料经常被模仿，但很难被打败；然而，人们普遍认为下面的食谱最接近于坐在著名的瓦伦林树酒馆顶上，手捧他自酿的黑啤酒的感觉。这些土豆可以与菜单上的任何红烧肉搭配，也可以与鸡蛋搭配，作为一天的开胃菜。",
	"There isn't much to see and even less to eat in the frozen tundra that is Icewind Dale...unless you know where to look. North of the Spine of the World and hidden in the windswept shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, stand three freshwater lakes that support the ten villages that dot their shores—a region aptly known as Ten Towns. The lakes of Ten Towns are unremarkable, except for one feature: they are the only known location of the storied knucklehead trout. Named for their thick, knuckle-shaped skulls, these fish have become the region's most lucrative export, not for their culinary value but rather for the finely crafted scrimshaw that local artisans make with the ivory-like headbones. Merchants from Luskan and beyond pay top dollar for these curios, which have become all the rage throughout the cities of Faerûn. As a result, lakes of Ten Towns often run red with the blood of local fisherman competing for the day's catch. However, what's less known outside of the region is that these rare fish are as delicious as they are valuable, especially when pan-fried with shallots, lemon, salt, pepper, and paprika. If you can't source fresh knucklehead trout from the lakes of Ten Towns, don't dismay. Trout from Nyr Dyv near the City of Greyhawk or Crystalmir Lake close to Solace will suffice as substitutes.": "在冰风谷这个冰冻的苔原上，没有什么可看的，更没有什么可吃的......除非你知道去哪里找。在世界之脊的北面，隐藏在凯尔文之巢的风影中，有三个淡水湖，支撑着湖岸边的十个村庄--这个地区被称为十镇。十镇的湖泊并不起眼，只有一个特点：它们是唯一已知的传说中的节头鳟鱼的所在地。这些鱼因其厚厚的、指节状的头骨而得名，已成为该地区最有利可图的出口产品，不是因为它们的烹饪价值，而是因为当地工匠用象牙般的头骨制作的精巧的装饰品。来自卢斯坎和其他地方的商人为这些古玩支付了高价，这些古玩已经成为整个法鲁恩城市的热门。因此，十镇的湖泊经常被当地渔民为争夺当天的渔获而流下的鲜血染红。然而，在该地区以外鲜为人知的是，这些罕见的鱼和它们的价值一样美味，尤其是在用香葱、柠檬、盐、胡椒和辣椒粉煎制时。如果你不能从Ten Towns的湖泊中找到新鲜的节节鱼，不要沮丧。灰鹰城附近的Nyr Dyv或靠近索拉斯的Crystalmir湖的鳟鱼就可以作为替代品。",
	"Whether you're a warrior doffing your plate mail after an arduous adventure or a wizard relaxing after a studious session in the stacks, each day demands time for repose. From an obscure oolong to a common chamomile, teas are imbued with incredible calming and restorative effects for the body and soul. The powerful white-robed Highmage Par-Salian was renowned for his arcane prowess, but those close to him warmly recounted his potent tea leaf homebrew as well. A single saucer full of this extraordinary blend, which was known to include a fresh ginger infusion with honey, chamomile, dried lemon, orange peel, and a dash of slippery elm bark (granting it a smooth, oily aftertaste) among its components, was said to soothe even the most dogged cold—an effect that ensured the survival of one of Par-Salian's most famous students, Raistlin Majere.

	"In the world of Krynn, shortly after the ancient Kinslayer Wars, Prince Kith-Kanan appealed to his brother King Sithas for western sovereignty. His brother peacefully granted the western elves independence from the nation of Silvanesti. However, Kith-Kanan, the new king of the western elves, was met with decades of hardships resulting from the diaspora. Until their capital Qualinost was founded, his elven people struggled to find new ways of living off the land. Several simple and humble meals entered the repertoire of the elven diet, including \"Harvest Prize,\" an artfully prepared baked vegetable casserole. Sourceable produce such as eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomato were thinly sliced then stacked in fanned layers upon fresh basil and tomato (crushed into a sauce), then drizzled with fresh and fragrant oils before roasting. This humble yet abundant dish could feed an entire elven village at little cost. Although the elves of Krynn now prepare variations of this dish year-round with inspired substitutions to harness the seasons, the combination below is the most classic and recommended.": "在克莱恩的世界里，在古代弑君者战争之后不久，王子基斯-卡南向他的兄弟西塔斯国王呼吁获得西部的主权。他的哥哥和平地授予西部精灵从希尔瓦内斯蒂国家独立出来。然而，西部精灵的新国王基斯-卡南却遭遇了数十年的散居生活带来的艰难困苦。在他们的首都奎里诺斯特建立之前，他的精灵族人一直在努力寻找新的生活方式，靠土地生存。几种简单而简陋的饭菜进入了精灵族的饮食食谱，包括 \"丰收奖\"，一种精心准备的烘烤蔬菜砂锅。茄子、西葫芦、黄瓜和西红柿等可获得的农产品被切成薄片，然后在新鲜的罗勒和西红柿（压成酱）上叠成扇形，然后在烤之前淋上新鲜和芳香的油。这道简陋而丰富的菜肴可以用很少的成本养活整个精灵村。虽然克莱恩的精灵们现在一年四季都在准备这道菜的变体，并通过灵感的替换来驾驭季节，但下面的组合是最经典的，也是最值得推荐的。",

To endure the arduous cold of Icewind Dale, the Reghed and other similar groups, such as the Uthgardt of Northern Faerûn, must maximize time and energy to thrive. Communal meals at winter camps (constructed seasonally to survive the exceptionally long winter) are as central to their dignified warrior culture as their deep religious traditions. Venison (the meat of antelope, deer, or elk) is the most readily available, and thus coveted, finding various uses for these resourceful nomads, but beef or rothé is completely acceptable in other realms. One ceremonial dish (to which the Reghed stake proud claim) that marks the beginning of the long winter is pot roast.

	"Despite its promise of a \"banquet,\" the dish known as Eldeen Banquet is actually a hearty, one-dish meal sure to satisfy omnivores as much as vegetarians. Consisting of lightly breaded and fried eggplant topped with a warm, seasoned tomato sauce, this delight hails from the Eldeen Reaches, in the Khorvaire region of Eberron, which is noted for its robust forests and agriculture, and where the dish has occasionally migrated to the Feywild via a secret Fey Crossing. But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views. However, perhaps the best preparation is found in the unassuming Olladra's Arms, in the Hope's Peak district. Here, the portions are as generous as they are flavorful, ensuring the dish truly lives up to its moniker.": "尽管这道菜被称为 \"盛宴\"，但它实际上是一道丰盛的单菜，一定能满足杂食者和素食者的需求。这道美味来自艾伯伦的科尔韦尔（Khorvaire）地区的艾尔丁边缘地带（Eldeen Reaches），那里以茂密的森林和农业著称，这道菜偶尔会通过秘密的费伊通道迁移到费伊荒野。虽然艾尔丁宴被认为是一种地区美食，但在整个沙恩城的知名餐馆中，这种酥脆又松软的茄子馅饼也很常见。位于 Skyway 区的 Azure Gateway 和 Celestial Vista 等高档餐厅提供的 Eldeen Banquet 就像它们的美景一样令人愉悦。不过，在希望之峰区不起眼的奥拉德拉武器店里，也许能找到最好的准备。 这里的菜肴份量充足，味道鲜美，真正做到了名副其实。",
	"Centuries of deforestation has caused the elves of Elfharrow to get more creative with their diets than those of their forest-based counterparts. Raising livestock has become a way of life for these elves, making dairy a central staple of their foodways. This traditional Elfharrow dish features medallions of goat cheese crusted in breadcrumbs and baked. The key ingredient, though, is a tangy mustard, said to originate in the Feywild, and the dish goes best with a green salad on the side. A word of caution: Don't try to source your ingredients in Elfharrow—these elves are quite a bit more territorial and protective than their northern cousins and a visit there could be your last.": "几个世纪的森林砍伐使精灵哈罗的精灵在饮食上比森林里的精灵更有创意。饲养牲畜成了这些精灵的生活方式，奶制品也成了他们的主要食物。这道传统的精灵哈罗菜是用山羊奶酪块裹上面包屑烘烤而成。这道菜的主要配料是一种香浓的芥末，据说这种芥末起源于费尔德，最好配上一份绿色沙拉。提醒您一句： 不要试图在精灵之箭采购食材，这些精灵的领地意识和保护意识比他们的北方表亲要强得多，去那里可能是你最后一次了。",

A mosaic of colors and flavors, the thinly sliced vegetables, edible flora, and wild herbs are so elegantly placed atop this chewy focaccia that you almost want to admire it more than eat it. A cornucopia of garden-fresh components frequently make starring appearances—from onions, bell peppers, chives, and cherry tomatoes to sunflowers, elderflowers, squash blossoms, and sprigs of basil. Almost nothing is off-limits when it comes to topping; the only (unspoken) rule is to keep it vibrant and arrange them artfully. Despite elven flatbread being a \"simple\" bread recipe, Feywild eladrin pride themselves on flare and personal presentation.

Traditional Elverquisst vintages are distilled from orosks and resmers (rare summer fruits indigenous to Evereska) and sunshine, and it sips as smoothly as a cool mountain stream. Elves store their Elverquisst in crystal decanters capable of absorbing light and showcasing the tantalizing specks of gold dancing about in the rich claret mixture. According to legend, upon whispering a secret Elvish phrase, the sunlight streaming through the bottle will gather into thirteen points, resembling the constellation Correlian.

Gifted its name from the splash of chopped greens, intermingled with chunks of fowl, chicken livers, onions, and a strong dash of incendiary spices, Emerald Chicken demands an adventurous palate—it was originally made for tieflings with fiendspices—and a cool glass of ale to quench the burn. A milder version became famous in far-off Purskul, on Toril, in eateries such as the Owlroost Head.": "事实上，进出西吉尔城的唯一通道就是这座城市数不胜数的传送门之一。在西格尔城，人们必须品尝著名的翡翠鸡，这也是不争的事实。翡翠鸡之所以得名，是因为鸡肉中夹杂着切碎的蔬菜、大块的鸡肉、鸡肝、洋葱和浓烈的香料。翡翠鸡需要冒险家的味觉--这道菜最初是为带有恶魔香料的铁匠做的，还需要一杯清凉的麦酒来解酒。在遥远的托瑞尔（Toril）的普斯库尔（Purskul），\"猫头鹰之头\"（Owlroost Head）等餐馆里，一种口味较淡的鸡肉非常有名。",

The nuanced yet indulgent combination of fresh sweet peas, shallots, and feta cheese is a match made in Arvandor, especially once handfuls of the bite-size bounty are dipped in batter and fried to perfection. From Prismeer to Evermeet, elves and those with whom they hold court relish these comforting table treats. Fey Fritters come with a warning: Once you try one, you'll want to spend all day eating these scrumptious snacks...and often, in the Feywild, you just do!

	"Fig cakes are an easily preserved pouch snack for explorers with a sweet tooth. A perfect fig cake is as much about the fig as it is about the lightly toasted and ground almonds that form this fruity confection's chewy base. While honeyed fig tarts were extremely popular in Calimshan on the planet Toril, it is believed that this unique dessert originally hailed from the desolate wastes of the Shadowfell. Developed by the elves native to the Plane of Shadow called the Shadar-Kai, these treats are sweet enough to be at home even in the dreamy Feywild. In addition to the sesame seeds and anise seeds, a strong brandy is often infused into the mix, to both sweeten and fortify these small pressed cakes. While fig cakes do not come cheap, they are, nonetheless, a proud (and delicious) reminder of the resourcefulness of the Shadar-Kai.": "对于喜欢甜食的探险家来说，无花果蛋糕是一种易于保存的袋装零食。一块完美的无花果蛋糕既要有无花果的香味，也要有杏仁的嚼劲。虽然蜂蜜无花果馅饼在托瑞尔星球的卡里姆山非常流行，但人们相信这种独特的甜点最初是来自荒凉的暗影荒原。这种甜点由阴影界的精灵--沙达凯人研制而成，即使在梦幻的仙境中也甜美无比。除了芝麻和茴香籽，无花果饼中还经常加入浓烈的白兰地，既能增加甜味，又能强化这些小压制饼的口感。虽然无花果饼的价格并不便宜，但它们却是沙达尔-凯人引以为豪（和美味）的足智多谋的象征。",

It is also ideal in environments where livestock is harder to keep, such as the Underdark and the Rock of Bral. The original gnome version uses chicken broth as a base, but vegetable broths work just as well.

Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead.": "咖啡（Kaeth）是一种用磨碎的烘焙咖啡豆制成的芳香饮料，以其提神醒脑的特性而闻名，是多元宇宙世界中最普遍的开胃饮料。在门之城西格尔，星球观光者可以品尝到来自无数星球的各种咖啡豆和饮料。在托瑞尔星球，人们通常称其为 \"Kaeth\"，这种咖啡在剑海岸已经发展成了一种美味佳肴，现在大量进口到这里。在森比亚国，一种流行的制作方法是将融化的巧克力和酒混合在一起。在某些地区，Kaeth 是如此受欢迎，以至于它比茶叶贸易更有利可图。克林星球上的人们饮用焦豆茶和凯福瑞茶，这两种茶都是用充满活力的黑豆烘焙而成，通常是黑茶。与此相反，外星球的居民则饮用大量的香料茶和奶油茶，其中包括著名的天体山陛下茶。 在奥尔斯星球，咖啡的酸性更强，经常被混入奶油酒中，以增加口感。但最著名的可能要数 kav'la，它将奶油椰奶搅入麦芽糖、深色坚果烤肉中，用高大华丽的陶瓷器皿盛装，在西格尔的文化集市上很容易找到。无论您选择哪种口味，Kaeth 都能以各种形式为您提供咖啡因提神剂，无论是在山路上还是在安全的家中。",
	"Kender loaf, or raston pastry as it has been called, is a filling, raisin-specked dessert to round out a hearty meal. However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today.": "坎德人面包，或称拉斯顿糕点，是一种馅料丰富、葡萄干点缀的甜点，为丰盛的晚餐锦上添花。然而，拉斯顿糕点的早期形态可以追溯到第一次龙族战争时期，当时连过期面包屑都不能丢弃。人们习惯把过期面包的面包皮扔进盆里，然后捣碎制成牲畜饲料，但坎德人看到了商机。过期的面包被从其他半成品中分离出来，浸泡在水中，加糖、加香料和烘干，然后制成所谓的 \"坎德人面包\"（kender loaf），也就是人们常说的 \"二手面包\"。坎德人面包如此受欢迎，以至于在制作过程中加入了鸡蛋、奶油和香料，演变成了我们今天所知的面包布丁。",
	"Kender legends have a way of shifting and swaying merrily with the tides of the Blood Sea of Istar. An early tale held that kender stumblenoodles were born of a collision between two frantic kender cooks—when their pots mixed, it resulted in an unexpected alliance of flavors and ingredients. However, ask a kender adventurer, and you may as likely hear a yarn concerning a well-placed insult aimed toward a draconian corporal and his squad. As the bold kender scoundrel made haste to flee, he frantically threw about any valuables behind him to dissuade his pursuers. In his desperation, he ejected a small sack of mixed spices, hardened cheese, a jar of mustard, and several handfuls of uncooked spiral pasta shells that, as kender luck would have it, served as a meal of caltrops for draconian toes and sent the kender's pursuers stumbling into the mud. In honor of this brave kender's sacrifice (the loss of a perfectly good sack of pasta), kender across Krynn have memorialized the occasion in classic, good-humored kender fashion.": "坎德人的传说总是随着伊斯塔血海的潮汐欢快地变幻和摇摆。一个早期的传说认为，坎德人的绊脚石面条诞生于两个疯狂的坎德人厨师之间的碰撞--当他们的锅子混合在一起时，就产生了意想不到的味道和配料的结合。然而，如果你问一个坎德人冒险者，你很可能会听到一个关于对一个强盗下士和他的小队进行侮辱的故事。当这个大胆的坎德人无赖匆忙逃跑时，他疯狂地把所有值钱的东西都扔到身后，以驱散追兵。在绝望中，他射出了一小袋混合香料、硬奶酪、一罐芥末和几把未煮熟的螺旋面壳，坎德人的运气不错，这些东西成了龙人脚趾的钙片大餐，让坎德人的追兵跌跌撞撞地摔进了泥地里。 为了纪念这位勇敢的坎德人的牺牲（失去一袋完美的意大利面），整个克莱恩的坎德人都以经典、幽默的坎德人方式来纪念这一时刻。",
	"Nothing warms the soul quite like the scent of a freshly baked kender cobbler. The flavor of this effervescent blend of peaches, dark berries, vanilla, cloves, and liquor (for the brave, a sizable enough dash to make your toes tingle) is as fascinating as the diminutive folk who invented it. Kender—said to be birthed of magic and chaos—approach food in much the same manner as they traverse the worlds of the multiverse: adventurously. The buttery, flaky topping oozing with soft, chopped peaches should be enough, but when combined with blueberries, the cobbler filling brightens in a curiously kender way. This dessert is especially popular on Mid-year Day in Sixthmonth, which also happens to be Peach Month in Ansalon, but it remains the dessert of choice for the kender of Krynn regardless of holiday or season. Often served as a cobbler, sometimes as a crumble, but never to be skipped, especially when offered warm with a hefty dollop of fresh whipped cream.": "没有什么比新鲜出炉的坎德人馅饼的香味更能温暖人心了。这种混合了桃子、黑浆果、香草、丁香和烈酒（对于勇敢的人来说，少许的烈酒足以让你的脚趾发麻）的泡腾片的味道就像发明它的矮小的人一样迷人。坎德人--据说是魔法和混沌的产物--对待食物的方式就像他们穿越多元宇宙一样：冒险。黄油、薄片状的表层渗出柔软的桃子碎，这就足够了，但如果再加上蓝莓，馅料就会以一种奇特的坎德人方式变得鲜亮起来。这道甜点在第六月的年中节特别受欢迎，而这一天恰好也是安萨隆的桃子月，但无论在哪个节日或季节，它都是克莱恩坎德人的首选甜点。它通常以馅饼的形式出现，有时也以面包屑的形式出现，但绝对不会被省略，尤其是在热食时加上一大勺新鲜的鲜奶油。",
	"The Yawning Portal of Waterdeep serves a new pie every week, based on the seasonal ingredients available. You're really in luck when laumberries from the frosty Frozenfar are in season. Their tartness is softened by the sweetness of the dough, making it the perfect blend of flavors. The famous tavern likely pilfered the idea from the hardy bakers of Bryn Shander. Pies in this style are made off-season with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, which together give you something of the flavor of the original. They're best served a bit chilled, and when done right have been known to resurrect the spirits of weary adventurers emerging from the Undermountain.": "水深城的打哈欠之门每周都会根据时令食材供应新派。当冰霜之远的橘子成熟时节，您就真的走运了。面团的甜味软化了它们的酸味，使各种口味完美融合。这家有名的酒馆很可能是从布林山德（Bryn Shander）勤劳的面包师那里剽窃来的创意。这种馅饼是在淡季用蓝莓、黑莓和覆盆子制作的，这三种水果搭配在一起就能做出原汁原味的馅饼。冰镇后食用效果更佳，如果制作得当，还能让疲惫不堪的冒险者从地下山中重新振作起来。",

But there is no better reason to visit this famous haven for adventurers than its delectable Loaf Pudding. A specialty of halfling head-chef Chenna Fatrabbit and her human pastry sidekick, Klav Martilmur, this moist, yogurt-infused loaf is soaked in a delicious vanilla-almond syrup and topped with a sprinkle of salted almonds to add just the right amount of crunch.

Likened in both flavor and scent to cinnamon, Mingari spice is a rare but highly sought-after seasoning indigenous to southeast Faerûn. Although rare, this strong, aromatic spice is incredibly versatile, at home in both sweet and savory dishes, and thus it has spread throughout the Realms and beyond.

The surprisingly crisp and refreshing cocktail is so rich in flavor, it is often consumed in lieu of dessert or as an accompaniment to lighter fare.

This dish has been served for many generations by the hard-working denizens of Purskul (the \"Granary City\"), a bustling and notable caravan stop inland from Athkatla, between Amn's Cloud Peak and the Small Teeth mountains in West Faerûn. Lamb and potato stew is simmered for hours, then drained before being wrapped in thick and chewy flatbread the size of a small shield.

Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter.

Since Sigil has no natural resources, silverfruit is one of the many uniquely curated imports from the vast array of worlds to which the greater metropolis provides access.": "众所周知，银果又名荔枝或皂荚，是真正的天堂派。这种中等大小、粉红色果皮的浆果以特别脆嫩多汁而闻名，还带有一丝柑橘和花香。但作为馅料，它的奶油和奶油冻的口感却出人意料，配上烤得松软的饼皮，更是绝配。金巴利亚尔客栈（位于西吉尔的夫人病房）专门接待来自上层行星的高级客人，这里的丝滑甜点美味得令人惊叹。由于西格尔没有天然资源，银果是许多独特的舶来品之一，这些舶来品来自大都市所能到达的众多世界。",
	"Popular at holiday gatherings of humans and elves alike, sornstag is a simmered venison dish that can be seasoned and prepared in a variety of ways. Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road.": "在人类和精灵的节日聚会上，Sornstag 都很受欢迎，这是一道用鹿肉煨制的菜肴，可以用多种方法调味和烹制。传统的精灵炖鹿肉是在浓汤中加入磨碎的香菜、孜然、辣香料或咖喱慢慢熏制而成，是木精灵在丰收节期间最受欢迎的一道菜。人类也采用了自己的炖煮技术来烹制这种野味浓郁但肉质鲜美的主菜。在法厄恩的森林地区，人类猎杀雄鹿，既是为了运动，也是为了美食，因此以鹿肉为原料的菜肴层出不穷。在达勒恩森林和田野中，最受欢迎的 Sornstag 地区食谱需要一整天的准备时间。传统食谱要求将杏仁粉与红酒一起熬煮，形成辛辣酱汁的乳化基底，将肉浸泡在其中过夜，然后从黎明开始用明火慢炖，在傍晚时分享用。 不过，要想更快地把鹿肉端上餐桌，您可以省去隔夜腌制的工序，只需在烤箱里烤上几个小时即可。值得注意的是，埃森布拉的银酒窖（Silver Taproom）吸引了来自四面八方的旅行者，他们争相品尝这里著名的炖鹿肉馅饼（pied sornstag）。当香气扑鼻的馅饼飘散在熙熙攘攘的劳特霍威尔路上时，您就知道炖鹿肉馅饼做好了。",
	"It's rare to see this halfling specialty on the table, usually because it's gone before you ever catch a glimpse of it. Perfect for morningfeast, or teatime, the much-celebrated sour cream-walnut cake includes a delicious crumble of cinnamon, brown sugar, and walnuts, but it's the cake itself that takes the cake. A recipe passed down orally by generations of halflings, it is said to be made with the finest Luiren grain flour, fresh sour cream, and finely ground kaeth or coffee. The only known issue with the pastry is that there never seems to be enough of it.": "很少能在餐桌上看到这种半身人特产，通常是因为你还没看到它，它就已经消失了。酸奶油核桃蛋糕非常适合早饭或茶点时间食用，它包括美味的肉桂碎、红糖和核桃，但蛋糕本身才是最重要的。半身人世代口口相传的配方，据说是用最好的卢仁谷物面粉、新鲜酸奶油和磨细的凯斯或咖啡制成的。唯一已知的问题是，蛋糕似乎永远都不够吃。",
	"It is said, \"When in space, do as spacefarers do,\" and this can prove useful advice when talking about food. One will never know how, or why, pork became such a readily available source of protein on the Rock of Bral, but that mystery is beside the point when a steaming bowl of spiced pork and orange peppers is on offer. In truth, the underside of the one-mile-long ovaloid asteroid, founded by humanoid Captain Bral, serves as a sustainable and farmable ecosystem capable of oxygen production. It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost. When ordered \"the Captain's way,\" the explosion of spices (paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic, fennel, cumin, and some mystery space seed grown onsite) combined with the zest of the orange peppers is like a peg-legged dohwar kick straight to the taste buds.": "俗话说：\"在太空中，要像太空宇航员那样做。\"这句话在谈论食物的时候很有用。人们永远不会知道猪肉是如何或为什么成为布拉尔岩石上如此容易获得的蛋白质来源的，但当一碗热气腾腾的香猪肉和橙色辣椒端上桌时，这个谜就不重要了。事实上，这颗一英里长的椭圆形小行星由人形的布拉尔船长创建，其底部是一个可持续发展的、可耕种的生态系统，能够生产氧气。这里甚至还有一个淡水湖（布拉尔湖），经常由从冰小行星上采集的水补给。香料猪肉和橘子胡椒是著名的布拉尔船长的最爱，也一直是由好客的大块头路易吉经营的 \"笑看客 \"餐厅和其他点缀在这个无法无天的小行星前哨站大道上的明显不雅食肆的招牌菜。 以 \"船长的方式 \"点菜时，各种香料（辣椒粉、香菜、卡宴辣椒、大蒜、茴香、小茴香和一些现场种植的神秘太空种子）与橙色辣椒的果皮结合在一起，就像一脚踢在味蕾上。",
	"A refreshing nonalcoholic aperitif, the drink known as Sprucebark Quaff is famous throughout the multiverse for not only preparing the palate for flavor but also freshening the breath after meals. A simple concoction of clean, fresh water; mint; and sweet cucumber, it is served at upscale taverns, inns, and temples across the Prime Material Plane but is especially popular in the Feywild and upper planes, where a similar mixture forms naturally in many ponds, lakes, and streams. It's believed to have been invented by Faerûnian elves as a method of purifying water, using plants to remove toxins. Whatever its origin, it is sure to recharge trail-weary adventurers no matter what planet or plane they roam.": "云杉皮 Quaff 是一种清爽的无酒精开胃酒，闻名于整个多元宇宙，不仅能让味蕾准备好享受美味，还能在饭后清新口气。这种饮料由干净的清水、薄荷和甜黄瓜简单调制而成，在整个主物质位面的高档酒馆、旅店和寺庙中都有供应，但在费伍德和上层位面尤其流行，因为那里的许多池塘、湖泊和溪流中都会自然形成类似的混合物。据说这是法努精灵发明的一种净水方法，利用植物去除毒素。不管它的来源如何，它一定能让疲惫不堪的冒险者重新振作起来，无论他们在哪个星球或位面漫游。",
	"According to legend, this hearty seafood steak was first prepared by homesick triton folk living among surface dwellers and eager for a nostalgic taste of their undersea home. Guardians of the deep, commonly clustered around ocean trenches and far from the eyes and reach of humankind, triton have increasingly emerged from self-imposed isolation to cohabit with the other peoples of the multiverse. A satisfying synthesis of tastes that borrows more from the surface world than from the seafloor, steak of the deep features a thick slab of braised swordfish, topped with a simmered tomato-based blend of onion, garlic, paprika, and a crisp dry sherry, yielding a fragrant and filling main course. While you won't find this in many triton settlements proper, it is a mainstay meal for well-traveled triton and is increasingly available at larger coastal taverns and, occasionally, the more far-flung spaceports of Realmspace.": "据传说，这种丰盛的海鲜牛排最初是由生活在海面上的思乡的天龙人烹制的，他们渴望怀念自己的海底家园。天龙人是深海的守护者，通常聚集在海沟周围，远离人类的视线和触角，他们越来越多地摆脱自我封闭，与多元宇宙中的其他民族共同生活。深海牛排是一道口味令人满意的综合菜肴，它更多地借鉴了海面世界而非海底世界的烹饪方法，以厚厚的红烧剑鱼为主料，配以以番茄为基础的洋葱、大蒜、辣椒粉和清脆的干雪利酒煨制而成，是一道香味浓郁、营养丰富的主菜。虽然这道菜在许多三体人聚居地并不常见，但它却是旅行在外的三体人的主食，在大型沿海酒馆以及偶尔在更遥远的星际空间港口，这道菜的供应量越来越大。",
	"Those who happen upon the Solamnian city of Palanthus would be fools not to drop by the A Taste of Silvanost restaurant and try its famous Stuffed Trout. Of course, what the trout is stuffed with is anyone's guess. According to the menu (which is written in Silvanesti), you'll find \"specially prepared mixtures\" inside. But rumor has it the stuffing is composed of breadcrumbs made from the fresh-baked loaves of the elven proprietor Solamna Farseer, and seasoned with a rare spice known as Old Bay, named for the Bay of Branchala, next to which the city rests.": "来到索兰尼亚城市帕兰瑟斯的人，如果不去 \"希尔瓦诺斯特之味 \"餐厅品尝一下著名的酿鳟鱼，那就太傻了。当然，鳟鱼的馅是什么谁也说不准。根据菜单（用希瓦内斯提语书写），您会发现里面有 \"特别准备的混合物\"。但有传言说，馅料是由精灵老板索拉姆娜-法赛尔（Solamna Farseer）新鲜出炉的面包屑做成的，并用一种名为 \"老海湾\"（Old Bay）的稀有香料调味。",
	"The palm-size sandwich known as talyth is a beloved appetizer on many a menu, from Waterdeep and the rustic watering holes of Luskan to the cloistered refectories of Candlekeep and eateries as far east as the Sea of Fallen Stars where, it is said, the dish originated. Although countless variations exist, talyth commonly comprises meats (typically sliced sausage), cheese, spices, and herbs nestled between two large crackers, all lightly baked to adhere the layers. While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major Faerûnian trade routes. Although frozen talyth can easily be reheated on an open campfire, freshly made talyth affords a more eclectic and adventurous array of savory ingredients, including diced egg, oysters, snails, and even spiced worms.": "从水底城（Waterdeep）和卢斯坎（Luskan）的乡村小酒馆，到烛龙堡（Candlekeep）的隐居食堂，以及远至东方堕星海（Sea of Fallen Stars）的食肆，被称为 \"talyth \"的手掌大小的三明治是许多菜单上深受喜爱的开胃菜，据说这道菜就起源于堕星海。虽然有无数种不同的做法，但塔利斯饼通常由肉类（通常是香肠片）、奶酪、香料和香草组成，夹在两块大饼干中间，轻轻烘烤使各层饼干粘合在一起。烘烤过程不仅能保持风味，还能确保其便携性，这使得塔利斯成为法厄尼亚主要贸易路线上常见的旅行小吃。虽然冷冻的塔利斯饼干可以很容易地在露天篝火上加热，但新鲜制作的塔利斯饼干可以提供更多的美味配料，包括鸡蛋丁、牡蛎、蜗牛，甚至香料虫子。",

Some of the finest examples exist a few miles to the south of Trademeet in Mosstone, at the venerable Drover's Last Drink, where they add a bit of vanilla and large-crystal sugar to the mix.

	"A famous dish from the Inn of the Last Home, perhaps the most storied tavern in all of Krynn, Tarsis-Style Shrimp is a rich and creamy, belly-filling shellfish concoction. In this delectable maritime offering, poached shrimp are combined with a fresh yogurt-dill sauce, which can be delightful when dolloped atop long, homemade noodles. In a popular iteration of this dish, detailed in the culinary notes of Tika Waylan, former barmaid at the inn, \"pulled turkey breast is substituted for the shrimp and enlivened with a dash of dry white wine.\" The sauce itself is so flavorful, it can perk up even the most mundane meats, something resourceful locals were forced to do post-Cataclysm, which left the Tarsis seaport landlocked.

Typically made with a firm white fish, like sea bass, the secret weapon of these delicacies is said to be the seasoning—a tantalizing mix of paprika, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Today, you can sample these crispy treats throughout the Rock of Bral. Some street chefs fry them in a skillet, though connoisseurs insist the open flame yields the best texture.

Even when civilization along the Sword Coast advanced, the pre-Netherese tradition of serving food on edible plates remained. No longer used for pure utility, trencher bread is traditionally prepared hard, flat, and dry, but it is lightly salted and seasoned to make the \"second course\" more appealing.
