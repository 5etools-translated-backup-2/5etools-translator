	"Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was.

	"The Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:": "万物会计与估价》具有以下随机属性：",
	"One section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.": "书中有一节专门讨论凡人灵魂的谈判和估价。当这本书在拥有灵魂的生物 10 英尺范围内打开时，该生物必须进行 DC 22 的智慧自救。如果失败，这本书就会分析他们最大的愿望，并计算出他们放弃灵魂所需要的确切数额。这些信息会显示在卷轴中，使用者可以通过交易获得灵魂。救赎成功的生物只会在书页中显示一个问号，并对进一步的估价免疫。",
	"When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from (%0%). In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse.": "当《万物清算与估价》被用作魔法书时，它保持着一种强制获取灵魂的独特能力。任何被书中抄录的咒语杀死的生物，其灵魂都会被从身体中剥离并送往米诺洛斯。在这个过程中，除了（%0%）之外，主体将对所有形式的复活免疫。作为灵魂的报酬，玛门会在他们的尸体上掉落相当于（20×等级）或（2×等级）的金币。",
	"The tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma ((%0%)) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma ((%1%)) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon.

	"Destroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome.

	"The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book.

The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.": "如果玛门不在或不愿意，第二个办法就是焚化这本书。要完成这项任务，必须熔化一罐白金（价值不低于 99,999 金便士），足以将书完全浸没。准备好铂金后，将巨著投入熔化的溶液中，巨著就会融化。这个过程会彻底毁掉巨著和铂金。",
