	"The balance beam is (%0%). A creature that ends its turn on the beam or that is on the beam when it tilts must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to keep its balance. If the walls are magnetized (see below) and the creature is wearing metal armor or holding metal equipment, the creature has disadvantage on this save. A creature that fails the save by 4 or less slips, landing on the beam, and has the (%1%) condition. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more falls into the gear pit (see \"Gear Pit\" below).": "平衡木是 (%0%)。在横梁上结束回合的生物或在横梁倾斜时处于横梁上的生物必须进行 DC 12 的灵巧蓄力才能保持平衡。如果墙壁被磁化了（见下文），而生物又穿着金属盔甲或拿着金属装备，则该生物在这次蓄力中处于劣势。生物如果失败了 4 次或更少，就会滑落到横梁上，并出现 (%1%) 状况。失败 5 次或更多的生物会掉入齿轮坑（见下文 \"齿轮坑\"）。",
	"When the balance beam's weight is on the pressure plate, the metal walls emit a magnetic field. Any creature wearing metal armor or holding metal equipment who isn't on the beam is pulled to the nearest metal wall and sticks to it, taking 11 ((%0%)) bludgeoning damage. Any creature stuck to the wall has the (%1%) condition until the magnetic field deactivates. Removing pressure from the plate—such as by putting more weight on the opposite end of the beam—deactivates the magnetic field.

Those gears remain jammed until the end of the character's turn, whereupon the Tiny object tumbles loose, falls through the gears, and is lost.": "每当有生物掉入坑洞或在坑洞中结束回合时，该生物必须在 DC 17 的灵巧蓄力中成功，否则会受到 55（(%0%)）重击伤害并出现 (%1%) 状况。在齿轮上（%2%）的生物如果不先使用一个动作和一个微小物体卡住下面的齿轮，就无法使用移动站起来。这些齿轮会一直被卡住，直到角色的回合结束，此时微小物体会松动，从齿轮中掉落并消失。",

	"The silver orb, which is 0.3 metre in diameter, can't be removed while the talons clutch it. The pedestal is trapped. Touching the silver orb causes the talons to snap closed.

The talons have an AC of 19, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "直径 0.3 米的银色球体被利爪紧紧抓住，无法取出。基座被困住了。触碰银色球体会导致利爪闭合。试图夺取银球的生物会受到 11（(%0%)）刀砍伤害，并在利爪抓住银球时出现 (%1%) 状况（逃脱 DC 15），银球会被释放。利爪的 AC 值为 19，命中点数为 10，对中毒和精神伤害免疫。",
	"With a successful DC 12 Wisdom ((%0%)) check, a character can spot the pressure plate that activates the talons through a narrow slit on the east side of the pedestal. A character can disable the pressure plate with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, which causes the talons to open. A Medium or Small creature (%1%) by the talons can't reach this pressure plate.": "通过成功的 DC 12 智慧（(%0%)）检定，角色可以通过基座东侧的窄缝发现启动利爪的压力板。角色可以使用盗贼工具通过成功的 DC 13 灵巧检定使压板失效，从而使利爪张开。利爪旁的中型或小型生物（%1%）无法触碰到这个压板。",

	"This gold key is 1.2 metre long and weighs 5 kilogramm. One round after it is removed from the sword stand, it comes to life, revealing itself to be a living object (use the (%0%) stat block). The key does everything it can to return to its stand, attacking anyone who tries to stop it. If the key is destroyed by reducing it to 0 hit points, it must be repaired (such as with the (%1%) spell) before it can be used in the skull door.": "这把金钥匙长 1.2 米，重 5 千克。从剑架上取下一轮后，它就会复活，显示出自己是一个有生命的物体（使用 (%0%) 状态块）。钥匙会竭尽全力返回剑架，攻击任何试图阻止它的人。如果钥匙的命中率降为 0 而被毁坏，则必须对其进行修复（例如使用 (%1%) 法术）后才能在骷髅门中使用。",
	"The oversized key fits the skull sculpture's nose. Inserting the key and turning it clockwise unlatches the door, which swings inward.": "特大号钥匙与骷髅雕塑的鼻子相吻合。插入钥匙并顺时针旋转，门就会打开，并向内旋转。",
	"The plants that cover the walls are fragile from the scorching light and not helpful for climbing. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Strength ((%0%)) check to climb the walls.": "覆盖墙壁的植物在灼热光线的照射下十分脆弱，不利于攀爬。角色必须通过 DC 12 力量（(%0%)）检定才能攀爬墙壁。",

	"A portcullis in the north wall blocks the way forward. Above the portcullis, a large glyph depicts a waxing crescent moon, its right edge illuminated by the faintest sliver of light. A large iron lever juts from the floor to the right of the portcullis.": "北墙上的栅栏挡住了前进的道路。栅栏上方有一个巨大的石刻，上面刻着一弯腊月，栅栏右边有一丝微弱的光亮。栅栏右侧的地板上伸出一根大铁杆。",

The bowl is impossible to climb out of without assistance such as rope or magic. The bowl's lip is flush with the floor, but the bowl wobbles slightly if pushed.": "碗宽 9 米，深 6 米，重 2 千克。它光滑的质地和形状使其成为困难的地形。进入碗内或在碗内结束回合的生物必须在 DC 15 的灵巧蓄力中成功，否则会出现 (%0%) 状况。如果没有绳子或魔法等辅助工具，碗是不可能爬出来的。碗的边缘与地面齐平，但如果用力推，碗会轻微晃动。",
	"Hidden beneath the bowl is an (%0%) that separates the bowl from a large weight scale just below it. The rod can be detected with the (%1%) spell.

	"Transmutation magic connects the scale to the moon glyph above the portcullis. As more weight is placed on the scale, the moon glyph above the portcullis gets fuller and glows brighter.

The portcullis remains open as long as the moon glyph remains full.": "转化魔法将天平与栅栏上方的月亮石刻连接起来。当秤盘上的重量增加时，栅栏上方的月亮石刻就会变得更圆、更亮。当秤盘上的压力达到 4 千克时，月亮石刻就会像满月一样被完全照亮，栅栏也会随之打开。只要月亮石刻保持满月状态，舷窗就会一直打开。",

	"When the lever is pulled, a mechanism in the floor pushes the button that deactivates the (%0%). The weight of the bowl causes the moon glyph to glow like a half moon. Simultaneously, valves open within the sewer pipes, releasing four oozes (see \"Monsters\" below) and a flood of water that pours from each pipe, down the channels on the floor, and into the bowl. The pipes release 1, kilogramm of water every minute. After 2 minutes, the bowl is full. After 4 minutes, several inches of water cover the floor, and enough water has poured into the room to illuminate the moon glyph; at this point, the flooding stops and the portcullis opens.": "拉动杠杆时，地板上的一个装置会按下按钮，使（%0%）失效。碗的重量会使月亮石刻像半月一样发光。同时，下水管道内的阀门打开，释放出四只渗液（见下文 \"怪物\"）和大量的水，这些水从每个管道中涌出，顺着地板上的通道流入碗中。管道每分钟释放 1 千克水。2 分钟后，碗就满了。4 分钟后，地板上积满了几英寸厚的水，涌入房间的水量足以照亮月亮石刻；此时，水流停止，栅栏打开。",
