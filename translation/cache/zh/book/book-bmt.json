	"For decades, DMs have used this infamous deck in their games, often with explosive results. Characters have been whisked off to extradimensional prisons, slain by death itself, lost levels, and earned the enmity of powerful fiends.

You can stack the deck with low-level effects that prompt roleplaying instead of mechanical changes or create a deck that has only good cards (or bad ones!) in it. You can do all this without losing the wonder of the deck: its unique nature as a physical object that players—not just their characters—can hold in their hands.": "但不一定非得如此。你可以为你的活动量身定制 (%0%)，使其符合你的需求和玩家的口味。你可以在卡组中堆叠一些低级效果，促使角色扮演而不是机械变化，或者创建一个只有好牌（或坏牌！）的卡组。你可以做到这一切，却不会失去卡组的奇妙之处：它是玩家（不仅仅是角色）可以拿在手中的实物，具有独特的性质。",

Here, the names of the cards first appeared, and the deck was expanded to twenty-two cards. These changes signaled the deck's transition from something inspired by playing cards to one inspired by the tarot; a traditional tarot deck also has twenty-two named cards known as the major arcana. The (%2%) also introduced the idea that there was more than one version of the deck; there was also a more common and less powerful version with only thirteen cards.": "随着 1979 年第一版 (%0%) 的出版，(%1%) 最为人熟知的部分也随之确立。在这里，牌名首次出现，牌面也扩展到 22 张。这些变化标志着这副牌从受扑克牌启发过渡到受塔罗牌启发；一副传统的塔罗牌也有二十二张命名的牌，被称为大奥卡纳。(%2%)还引入了一个概念，即这副扑克牌不止一个版本；还有一个更常见、功能更弱的版本，只有 13 张牌。",

In this story, author Robin Jenkins offered answers for some of the deck's most enigmatic questions: who made the deck, and why? Jenkins, through Jared, suggested the deck—or, more properly, decks, since the cards were rare but not unique—were created by gods of luck dwelling on the plane of Concordant Opposition (known now as the Outlands) to test the greed of hapless adventurers. The cards were distributed throughout the world by leprechauns, who were familiar with such tests as custodians of the pots of gold at the ends of rainbows.

At last, when characters found the (%1%) in a treasure hoard, the DM could offer them a physical deck to draw from. Barr also detailed the backs of the cards for the first time.

Each of the twenty-two doors had one card from the (%1%) built into it, so the door couldn't be opened without drawing the card. Moreover, the entire complex had been bolstered against an array of methods the characters might have taken to avoid interacting with the cards. To explore the dungeon, the characters had to draw every single card from the deck.

	"But in the fourth edition of D&D, artifacts were more than just magic items that couldn't be duplicated; they had minds of their own and pursued secret purposes.

Occasionally a deck manifested as something else entirely: a circle of twenty-two doorways, or a die with twenty-two sides, each roll of which had the power to change an individual's destiny.": "由于这副牌的神圣起源和非同寻常的性质，它很快就在整个多元宇宙中以无数较小的形式出现。这些奇妙的物品中，有些牌的数量较少，通常只有伊斯图斯读牌（%0%）时使用的 13 张牌。偶尔，一副牌也会以完全不同的形式出现：一个由二十二个门洞组成的圆圈，或者一个有二十二个面的骰子，每一次掷骰子都能改变一个人的命运。",
	"Soon those inspired by the deck sought to create their own magical cards. Most of these efforts resulted in entirely new magic items, such as the (%0%) (see (%1%)) or the (%2%) (see (%3%)).

Over the centuries, these Undead gathered to form the Grim Harrow, a horde of merciless hunters traveling the multiverse on a quest to find and destroy every manifestation of the deck so they can end their doomed existence (see (%2%) for more on these beings). To combat these dangers, an angel founded the Solar Bastion (see (%3%)), a benevolent organization dedicated to protecting innocent people from the decks and the many dangers they pose.": "(%0%) 夺走了许多生命。那些抽到骷髅头的人必须与（%1%）战斗，而那些被骷髅头杀死的人则会以亡灵的形式复活，只要卡组还在，他们就注定会存在。几个世纪以来，这些亡灵聚集在一起，形成了 \"狰狞哈罗\"（Grim Harrow），他们是一群无情的猎手，在多元宇宙中四处游荡，寻找并摧毁每一个卡组的化身，从而结束他们注定要失败的命运（关于这些生物的更多信息，请参阅（%2%））。为了对抗这些危险，一位天使创建了太阳堡垒（参见 (%3%) ），这是一个致力于保护无辜的人们免受卡组及其带来的诸多危险的仁慈组织。",

Perhaps it was the creation of a powerful faerie trickster or made by gods of chance as a test for greedy mortals. Use the story that best suits your campaign.": "但在你的活动中，这副牌可能有不同的故事。也许当伊斯图斯用 (%0%) 来读取 (%1%) 的未来时，它就已经存在了，而且它的起源完全不同。也许它是一个强大的精灵捣蛋鬼的杰作，或者是机缘之神为了考验贪婪的凡人而制作的。请选用最适合您的活动的故事。",
	"The power and unpredictability of a (%0%) gives it the potential to wildly alter the course of campaigns. In an instant, characters could inherit a keep, shifting the campaign's focus to its defense and maintenance; a character could become separated from the rest of the party, trapped in an undetectable and unreachable prison; or characters could instantly perish. While some groups embrace such surprising twists, others prefer to avoid major campaign upsets.": "(%0%) 的力量和不可预测性使其有可能极大地改变战役的进程。在一瞬间，角色可能会继承一座城堡，从而将活动的重点转移到城堡的防御和维护上；角色可能会与其他成员失散，被困在一个无法察觉、无法到达的监狱中；或者角色可能会瞬间消亡。有些团队乐于接受这种出人意料的转折，而有些团队则更倾向于避免重大的活动变故。",
	"This book provides tools to help you use the deck on your own terms. The following sections detail two ways to head off potential complications before the characters draw their first card. \"(%0%)\" suggests strategies for stacking the deck with only cards that will be fun for your group.

	"The rest of this book also contains a wealth of advice and tools that address the challenges posed by specific cards. For example, the keep described in (%0%) is perfect for any character who draws the Throne card. The three powerful fiends found in (%1%) make ideal enemies for those who draw the Flames card. (%2%) includes a full map of the Void's prison, as well as suggestions for working with players whose characters are imprisoned there. With these resources in hand, you'll be free to enjoy where the cards lead your characters.": "本书的其余部分还包含大量建议和工具，可应对特定卡牌带来的挑战。例如，(%0%) 中描述的城堡非常适合抽到王座卡的角色。(%1%)中的三个强大的恶魔是抽到火焰卡的角色的理想敌人。(%2%) 包括虚空监狱的完整地图，以及与角色被囚禁在那里的玩家合作的建议。有了这些资源，你就可以自由地享受卡牌将你的角色引向何方了。",
	"The easiest way to ensure the (%0%) doesn't radically alter your campaign is to limit the cards you include, selecting cards appropriate for the characters' level or that support the campaign's theme. The number and effects of the cards provided in the (%1%) are suggestions you can change as necessary. The deck has had many variations over D&D's history, so when you change it, you're in good company!": "要确保 (%0%) 不会从根本上改变你的活动，最简单的方法就是限制所包含的卡牌，选择适合角色等级或支持活动主题的卡牌。(%1%)中提供的卡牌数量和效果是建议性的，你可以根据需要进行更改。在 D&D 的历史上，这套卡牌曾有过许多变化，所以当你改变它时，你会有一个很好的伙伴！",
	"Here are examples of customized decks that reinforce a campaign's tone, appeal to particular kinds of players, or avoid specific dangers:": "以下是一些定制卡组的例子，这些卡组可以加强活动的基调，吸引特定类型的玩家，或避免特定的危险：",

	"Players who enjoy intense roleplaying and interacting with nonplayer characters will get the most from this deck: Balance, Fates, Flames, Knight, Rogue, Ruin, Sage, Throne.": "喜欢激烈的角色扮演和与非玩家角色互动的玩家将从这套卡组中获得最大收益： 平衡、命运、火焰、骑士、游侠、毁灭、贤者、王座。",
	"Most of the cards in this deck bestow benefits on those who draw them, and the few exceptions are relatively easily recovered from: Comet, Fates, Fool, Gem, Jester, Key, Knight, Moon, Ruin, Sage, Star, Sun, Throne.": "这套卡组中的大多数卡牌都能为抽到它们的人带来好处，少数例外的卡牌也相对容易恢复：彗星、命运、愚者、宝石、小丑、钥匙、骑士、月亮、毁灭、贤者、星辰、太阳、王座。",
	"In this deck, perhaps found in Ravenloft or similar settings, harmful cards far outnumber helpful ones: Balance, Comet, Donjon, Euryale, Flames, Fool, Jester, Puzzle, Rogue, Ruin, Skull, Talons, Void.": "在这套可能出现在 Ravenloft 或类似场景中的卡组中，有害的卡牌远远多于有益的卡牌： 平衡、彗星、唐戎、尤里亚尔、火焰、愚者、小丑、谜题、游侠、毁灭、骷髅、利爪、虚空。",
	"You can supplement these decks with cards from the (%0%), detailed in (%1%).": "您可以用 (%0%) 中的卡牌来补充这些卡组，详见 (%1%)。",
	"Traditionally, the effects created by the (%0%) are immediate. When a character draws the Knight card, a fighter immediately appears and offers their service, and a character who draws the Gem card might be literally showered with riches. While this suits some campaigns, you can take a more narrative approach to the deck by having cards foreshadow future events that occur at a time of your choosing. When you use the deck in this way, drawing from it is less like pulling the lever on a cosmic slot machine and more like allowing a character to select a new story for themself without being allowed to know that story ahead of time.": "传统上，（%0%）所产生的效果是立竿见影的。抽到骑士卡的角色会立即出现一名战士并提供服务，而抽到宝石卡的角色则可能真的会获得大量财富。虽然这适合某些活动，但你也可以采用一种更具叙事性的方式来使用这套卡组，让卡牌预示着在你选择的时间发生的未来事件。当你以这种方式使用卡组时，从中抽取卡牌就不像是拉动宇宙老虎机的杠杆，而更像是让角色为自己选择一个新的故事，但又不允许角色提前知道这个故事。",
	"With this narrative approach to the (%0%), you decide how to weave the events triggered by cards into your campaign. For example, a character who draws the Knight card might meet a warrior along the side of the road, in a tavern, or even trapped in a dangerous dungeon; by freeing the warrior, the character earns the warrior's loyalty. A character who draws the Gem card might find a rich store of jewels in their next treasure hoard, or they might inherit great wealth when a relative dies. Many of the chapters in this book include advice to help you work the effects of their cards into your campaign story.": "通过这种叙事方式（%0%），你可以决定如何将卡牌触发的事件编织进你的活动中。例如，抽到骑士卡的角色可能会在路边、酒馆，甚至被困在危险的地牢中遇到一位勇士；通过解救这位勇士，角色可以赢得勇士的忠诚。抽到宝石卡的角色可能会在下一个宝库中发现丰富的珠宝，也可能会在亲戚去世后继承巨额财富。本书的许多章节都包含了一些建议，可以帮助你将这些卡牌的效果融入到你的活动故事中。",
	"Using the deck's effects as events in your campaign poses an interesting question: is the deck predicting those events or causing them? If a character draws the Flames card, and soon after, minions of (%0%) (see (%1%)) try to capture them, is this a direct result of drawing the card, or would the demons have attacked them anyway? (%2%) doesn't answer this question; the answer is up to you and your players.": "将卡组的效果用作活动中的事件会带来一个有趣的问题：卡组是在预测这些事件还是在造成这些事件？如果一个角色抽到了火焰牌，不久之后，（%0%）（见（%1%））的小兵试图抓住他们，这是抽到这张牌的直接结果，还是恶魔无论如何都会攻击他们？(%2%) 没有回答这个问题；答案取决于你和你的玩家。",
	"When you take a narrative approach to the (%0%), don't put off card effects for too long. It's okay for players to wonder for a session or two exactly when and how the effects will manifest, and you can use that time to devise clever and memorable ways to interpret the effects and keep the players in suspense. For example, a beloved ally might come to hate a character who draws the Rogue card, and that ally might conceal their hatred for several sessions before revealing it in a moment of sudden treachery. But new stories soon crowd out the old, and players might not be impressed if a card takes too long to manifest.": "当你采用叙事的方式（%0%）时，不要把卡牌效果拖得太久。玩家可以在一两次游戏中猜测效果的具体时间和表现形式，你可以利用这段时间设计出巧妙而令人难忘的方式来解释效果，让玩家保持悬念。例如，一个受人爱戴的盟友可能会开始憎恨抽到 \"流氓 \"牌的角色，而这个盟友可能会将他们的憎恨隐藏几个回合，然后在突然背叛的一瞬间将其揭露出来。但是，新故事很快就会淹没旧故事，而且如果一张卡的显现时间过长，玩家可能不会留下深刻印象。",
	"This book provides several ways to introduce the (%0%) to your campaign, depending on the interests of your players and the kind of story you want to tell.": "本书提供了几种将 (%0%) 引入活动的方法，具体取决于玩家的兴趣和想要讲述的故事类型。",

This might be the first time that characters see the deck, and if they're willing to perform a service for (%3%), he might let them draw from it. This is a good way to introduce the deck to low-level characters.": "在 (%0%) 中描述的神秘精灵市场中，有一位名叫 (%1%) 的尼尔博格算命师，他使用 (%2%) 来为顾客预测未来。这可能是人物第一次看到这副牌，如果他们愿意为 (%3%) 提供服务，他可能会让他们从中抽签。这是向低级角色介绍牌组的好方法。",
	"Heroes of a more adventurous bent might explore the ruins of Gardmore Abbey presented in (%0%). The abbey has long been associated with the deck, since an ill-fated draw caused a massacre of both the knights who defended the site and the army that besieged them. Now the ruins are home to Mekkalath, a red dragon, and a (%1%) lies in his hoard. Few adventurers are powerful enough to challenge Mekkalath directly, but where might is insufficient, guile and cunning can prevail.": "喜欢冒险的英雄可以探索加德摩尔修道院的废墟（%0%）。这座修道院长期以来都与卡组有关，因为一次命运不济的抽签导致了保卫该地的骑士和围攻他们的军队遭到屠杀。现在，废墟成了红龙梅卡拉斯的家，他的囤积物中藏有一个 (%1%)。很少有冒险者有足够的力量直接挑战梅卡拉斯，但在力量不足的情况下，诡计和狡猾也能取得胜利。",
	"Finally, the characters might simply be given a deck by someone who wants them to have it. (%0%), mischievous fey presented in (%1%), are obsessed with the decks and constantly move them through the multiverse in a vain effort to manipulate destiny and complete a master plan only they understand. Alternatively, (%2%) or (%3%), detailed in (%4%), might give a deck to characters desperate to change their destiny.": "最后，人物可能只是被某个希望他们拥有卡组的人赠送了卡组。在（%1%）中出现的调皮煞星（%0%）痴迷于牌组，不断在多元宇宙中移动牌组，妄图操纵命运，完成只有他们才明白的大计划。另外，(%2%) 或 (%3%) （详见 (%4%)）可能会将牌组交给急于改变命运的角色。",
	"Hello there! I've snuck some notes throughout this book—it felt appropriate, given my experience with this wondrous deck. May my words provide you with insight and inspiration!": "你们好！鉴于我使用这副奇妙牌组的经历，我在本书中悄悄写了一些注释--我觉得这样做很合适。愿我的文字能给你带来启示和灵感！",
	"This section clarifies many things about how individuals can use and handle a (%0%) without triggering its fantastic powers. New magical abilities for each card are also provided, allowing characters who find only a few cards to engage with this magic item in their adventures.": "本节阐明了个人如何使用和处理 (%0%) 而不触发其神奇力量的许多事项。还为每张卡提供了新的魔法能力，让只找到几张卡的角色也能在冒险中使用这种魔法物品。",

	"This means that under normal circumstances, characters can handle a (%0%) safely. A character who finds a deck can look at it, spread the cards out, and otherwise manipulate the cards without triggering their effects. This is why folk are able to use decks as divinatory tools, placing cards before themselves to gain insight into the future or personal dilemmas without triggering the cards' effects.": "这意味着在正常情况下，角色可以安全地处理 (%0%)。找到卡组的角色可以查看卡组、摊开卡牌，或以其他方式操作卡牌，而不会触发其效果。这就是为什么民间可以将卡组用作占卜工具，将牌放在自己面前，在不触发牌效的情况下洞察未来或个人困境。",
	"But accidents do happen. A curious stranger who spots a deck, face down, might reach out to draw the topmost card without realizing the import of their actions, spurring an adventure that draws the characters' attention. While the decks aren't sapient and have no thoughts or goals of their own, many people report feeling a compulsion to draw from decks whenever they are near.": "但意外还是会发生。一个好奇的陌生人发现了一副面朝下的扑克牌，他可能会伸手抽出最上面的那张牌，却没有意识到自己行为的重要性，从而引发了一场冒险，引起了角色们的注意。虽然扑克牌没有灵智，也没有自己的思想或目标，但许多人都说，只要扑克牌靠近他们，他们就会感到有一种从扑克牌中抽取的冲动。",
	"A (%0%) typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.": "(%0%) 通常不是以单张卡牌的形式出现，而是以角色可以使用的卡牌集合的形式出现。但这并不一定是真的；你可以赋予每张卡牌作为独立物品的属性，这样，只找到一张卡牌的角色仍然可以享受这一著名物品，并在冒险中使用该卡牌。",

	"Anyone trying to make a card for the (%0%) must be at least 17th level. No formula for these cards exists, so the character must invent their own. While inventing the formula for such a potent magic item should take a long time, even years, a character can work on this project between or even on adventures. Characters might research their new formula by traveling to lost sites of ancient lore or locating others who have created cards of their own to learn how they accomplished this.": "任何试图为 (%0%) 制作卡片的人都必须至少达到 17 级。这些卡片没有配方，因此角色必须自己发明。虽然发明这种强效魔法物品的配方需要很长时间，甚至数年，但角色可以在工作间隙，甚至在冒险中进行这项工作。角色可以通过旅行到古代传说中的失落之地或找到其他已经创造出卡片的人，来研究他们的新配方，了解他们是如何做到这一点的。",
	"Once a character has invented the formula, they must acquire the magical ingredients—typically found only at great personal risk. Potential ingredients include magical inks made from crushed gemstones or the blood of legendary creatures, magical brushes or quills, and magical paper or other materials onto which the card must be painted (such as a dragon scale or a piece of the tarrasque's carapace). Great artistic skill is also required, so the creator might need to find a qualified artist or master the needed techniques themself. Furthermore, the magical ritual that creates the card must be performed at a specific time, perhaps when a particular constellation is in the sky. Divine intervention from a god of fate or destiny might be required.": "一旦角色发明了配方，他们就必须获得魔法材料--通常只有冒着极大的个人风险才能找到。可能的材料包括用碎宝石或传奇生物的血液制成的魔法墨水、魔法刷子或鹅毛笔，以及魔法纸张或其他必须绘制卡片的材料（如龙鳞或塔拉斯克的甲壳）。这还需要高超的艺术技巧，因此创作者可能需要找到一位合格的艺术家或自己掌握所需的技巧。此外，制作卡片的魔法仪式必须在特定的时间进行，也许是天空中出现特定星座的时候。可能还需要命运之神的干预。",
	"While a character might be driven to create a new card as a matter of personal pride or a testament to the individual's magical prowess, consider rewarding a character who achieves this mighty goal with a benefit like one or more of the following:": "角色可能会为了个人荣誉或证明自己的魔法实力而制作一张新卡牌，那么可以考虑为实现这一伟大目标的角色提供以下一项或多项福利作为奖励：",

	"Many card games rely on dealing hands of cards. You can use hands to represent a limited set of options in a situation, such as possible leads to pursue or actions to take. This is a fun way to offer players choices without overwhelming them with too many options.": "许多纸牌游戏都依赖于发牌。您可以用手牌来表示某种情况下的有限选项，例如可能的线索或采取的行动。这是一种有趣的方式，既能为玩家提供选择，又不会让他们不知所措。",
	"Drawing from a deck of cards is equivalent to rolling on a table of possible results. But when using cards, it's easy to prevent any undesired results: simply leave those cards out of the deck.": "从一副扑克牌中抽牌，就相当于在可能出现结果的桌子上掷骰子。但在使用扑克牌时，很容易防止出现任何不想要的结果：只需将这些牌从扑克牌中剔除即可。",
	"You can prevent repetition in a deck by removing cards once they've been drawn.": "您可以在抽出牌后将其移除，以防止牌组重复。",
	"You can assign meaning to a card's position or orientation in addition to its numeric or symbolic value.

Ask the character who flipped the card to make a DC 15 Wisdom ((%0%) or (%1%)) check to choose the best path.": "贤者（直立）。贤者这张牌暗示着一个获得洞察力或建议的机会。也许人物来到一个海角，可以看到周围数英里的地形。请翻牌的角色进行 DC 15 智慧（（%0%）或（%1%））检定，以选择最佳路径。",
	"Comet. Comets are harbingers of doom. If the character succeeds on the Wisdom check and chooses the better path, the characters' travel time decreases by a day, but their path is lined with omens that foretell terrible events when they reach their destination. If the character fails the Wisdom check and picks the worse path, the characters are troubled by nightmares that portend a disastrous future, preventing them from finishing a long rest that night.": "彗星 彗星是厄运的预兆。如果角色的智慧检定成功，选择了较好的道路，那么角色的旅行时间就会缩短一天，但他们的道路上会有预兆，预示着到达目的地后会发生可怕的事情。如果人物的智慧检定失败并选择了较差的路径，那么他们就会被预示着灾难性未来的噩梦所困扰，当晚无法完成长时间的休息。",
	"Jester (Reversed). When reversed, this card can represent misfortunes piling up in a way that might be humorous if it weren't so disastrous. Imagine the worst possible day of hiking through the wilderness, and describe the litany of horrors the characters face: biting insects and leeches, a sudden rainstorm making a river impassible, a broken backpack strap, lost or moldy rations, blistered feet, sunburn once the rain has cleared, and so on. For each hindrance you devise, have one character (starting with the character of the player who flipped the card, then rotating through the party) make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.": "小丑（逆转）。当这张牌反转时，它可以代表不幸的事情堆积如山，如果不是如此灾难性的话，这种方式可能会很幽默。想象一下在荒野中徒步旅行最糟糕的一天，然后描述人物所面临的一连串恐怖：咬人的昆虫和水蛭、突如其来的暴雨导致河流无法通行、背包带断裂、口粮丢失或发霉、脚起水泡、雨过天晴后被晒伤等等。每设计一个障碍，就让一名角色（从翻开卡片的玩家的角色开始，然后在整个队伍中轮换）进行 DC 10 的体质救赎。",
	"Fool. If the characters succeed on the majority of these saving throws, they stumble across a treasure: a (%0%) or a similar item used to fool or deceive. The reversed Fool card implies disappointment or lost innocence; if they fail most of the saving throws, they gain 2 levels of (%1%).": "愚弄 如果角色的大多数蓄力成功，他们会偶然发现一件宝物：（%0%）或用于愚弄或欺骗的类似物品。反面的愚人牌意味着失望或失去天真；如果他们的大部分蓄力失败，他们会获得 2 层 (%1%) 的 (%1%)。",
	"Donjon (Upright). This card can describe literal or metaphorical imprisonment. Perhaps the characters happen upon an eccentric's zoo, where monstrous animals are held in cruel captivity. The characters might decide to avoid the place entirely. Or they could free the monsters—hopefully avoiding the hungry ones—and confront the zoo's enraged owner.": "唐戎（直立）。这张牌可以描述文字或隐喻的监禁。也许主人公碰巧遇到了一个怪人的动物园，那里关押着残忍的畸形动物。角色们可能会决定完全避开这个地方。或者，他们可以放走怪兽--希望能避开饥饿的怪兽--然后与动物园愤怒的主人对峙。",
	"Gem. If the characters overcome the challenges of the menagerie, they discover valuable treasures there; if not, they must face one additional trap or monster that uses the appearance of treasure as bait, such as a (%0%).": "宝石 如果角色通过了动物园的挑战，他们就会在那里发现价值连城的宝藏；如果没有通过，他们就必须面对一个额外的陷阱或以宝藏外观为诱饵的怪物，如（%0%）。",
	"Using cards to generate random encounters is a dynamic alternative to rolling on encounter tables. You can customize an encounter deck and remove cards as you draw them so they don't repeat. You can also alter the encounter deck as characters explore an area, adding cards to the deck to reflect changing circumstances and weaving the encounters into a narrative.": "使用卡牌生成随机奇遇是在奇遇表上滚动的一种动态替代方式。您可以自定义奇遇卡组，并在抽取卡牌时将其移除，这样它们就不会重复出现。您还可以在角色探索某个区域时更改奇遇牌组，向牌组中添加卡片以反映不断变化的情况，并将奇遇编入叙事中。",

	"The following system is derived from (%0%) (2003).": "以下系统源自 (%0%) (2003)。",
	"Construct a deck of about twenty cards that each represent a creature (see the \"Constructing Your Deck\" section below). When an encounter occurs, shuffle the deck and draw a number of cards equal to the number of characters in the party. Use one or more of these cards to build the encounter, using the guidelines in the \"Choosing Monsters\" section below. When the encounter is over, discard the cards of any monsters that were killed, so they won't be drawn again.": "制作一副由大约 20 张牌组成的牌组，每张牌代表一种生物（请参阅下面的 \"制作牌组 \"部分）。当遭遇战发生时，洗牌并抽出与队伍中角色数量相等的牌。根据下面 \"选择怪物 \"部分的指导原则，使用其中一张或多张牌来构建奇遇。遭遇战结束后，丢弃所有被杀死的怪物的牌，这样它们就不会再被抽到。",
	"An encounter deck consists primarily of cards representing monsters. You can use cards from (%0%) card set, oracle cards, playing cards, cards from (%1%), or even index cards with your handwritten notes. Any kind of card works as long as each card can correlate with a specific monster. You can also add special cards for unusual events, as detailed below.": "奇遇卡组主要由代表怪物的卡片组成。您可以使用（%0%）卡组中的卡片、神谕卡、扑克牌、（%1%）中的卡片，甚至是带有手写笔记的索引卡。只要每张卡片都与特定的怪物相关联，任何类型的卡片都可以使用。您还可以为不寻常事件添加特殊卡片，详情如下。",
	"Choose ten to fifteen monsters with challenge ratings ranging from about half the level of the characters to 2 higher than their level. Usually you should include only one of the most powerful monsters, and you can include multiple copies of weaker monsters so they're more likely to be encountered.": "选择 10 到 15 个怪物，它们的挑战等级从角色等级的一半左右到比角色等级高 2 级不等。通常情况下，你应该只包含一个最强大的怪物，你也可以包含多个较弱怪物的副本，这样它们就更有可能被遇到。",
	"A group is a collection of creatures that might be encountered together. Identical creatures always form a group, but you can also form groups using other criteria. A group might be based on a shared creature type, such as Undead or Fiend, or might consist of creatures that often work together, such as gnolls and (%0%). Whenever you draw two or more creature cards of the same group for an encounter, those creatures work together against the party.": "群组是可能会一起遇到的生物的集合。相同的生物总是会组成一个群组，但也可以使用其他标准组成群组。群组可能基于共同的生物类型，例如亡灵或恶魔，也可能由经常一起行动的生物组成，例如地精和 (%0%)。每当你在遭遇战中抽到两张或两张以上的同组生物牌时，这些生物就会一起对抗队伍。",
	"Not all creatures need to belong to groups. You can add as many unaffiliated creatures as you like to your encounter deck. Create groups depending on how you'd like the characters to encounter the creatures.": "并非所有生物都需要属于某个组。您可以在奇遇卡组中添加任意数量的非隶属生物。根据角色与生物相遇的方式来创建组别。",
	"You can also designate single cards to represent two, three, or four creatures instead of just one. This ensures weak creatures appear in numbers sufficient to challenge the party without being overrepresented in the deck.": "您还可以指定单张卡牌代表两种、三种或四种生物，而不是只代表一种。这样既能确保弱小生物出现的数量足以挑战玩家，又不会在牌组中出现过多。",
	"You can include special cards in your encounter deck to add twists to encounters, such as surprise allies, additional adversaries, or goals the adventurers must accomplish. If you include special cards, a typical encounter deck of about twenty monster cards should also include three or four special cards.": "您可以在奇遇卡组中加入特殊卡牌，为奇遇增添新意，比如出其不意的盟友、额外的对手或冒险者必须完成的目标。如果你加入了特殊卡牌，那么由二十张左右怪物卡牌组成的典型奇遇卡组也应该包括三到四张特殊卡牌。",
	"A friend is a creature that helps the characters fight the other creatures in an encounter. The friend might be the sole survivor of another adventuring party, a solitary traveler or recluse, or a benevolent monster like a (%0%) or an angel. The friend might have information about the adventure location or the creatures that dwell there.": "朋友是一种在遭遇战中帮助角色与其他生物战斗的生物。朋友可能是其他冒险队伍的唯一幸存者、孤独的旅行者或隐居者，也可能是 (%0%) 或天使之类的仁慈怪物。朋友可能知道冒险地点或那里的生物的信息。",
	"When you draw a friend, set it aside. Then draw two additional cards and determine which foes the characters will face. The friend appears in the encounter with the other creatures, fighting on the side of the characters; you can let the players determine what the friend does on each of its turns.": "抽到朋友时，将其放在一边。然后再抽两张牌，决定角色要面对的敌人。朋友会和其他生物一起出现在遭遇战中，站在角色一边战斗；玩家可以决定朋友在每个回合中的行动。",

	"When you draw a lurker card, set it aside and determine what foes the characters will face as normal. The lurker appears in the encounter separate from the other monsters, as far from the characters as reasonably possible and hiding if it can, attacking once the characters are distracted.": "当你抽到一张潜伏者卡牌时，将其放在一旁，然后决定角色要面对的正常敌人。潜伏者在遭遇战中会与其他怪物分开出现，尽可能远离角色，并尽可能躲藏起来，一旦角色分心，它就会发动攻击。",
	"Lurkers might include Humanoid foes like bandits, as well as ambush predators such as (%0%), (%1%), and (%2%).": "潜伏者可能包括土匪等人形敌人，以及 (%0%)、(%1%) 和 (%2%) 等伏击捕食者。",
	"Twin creatures only appear together, though they need not be the same kind of creature.": "双胞胎生物只能同时出现，但不一定是同一种生物。",
	"If you draw both twin cards when an encounter occurs, the twin creatures appear in the encounter. If you draw only one twin card, shuffle it back into the deck and form the encounter as normal.": "如果在奇遇发生时抽到了两张孪生卡，孪生生物就会出现在奇遇中。如果只抽到一张孪生卡，则将其洗回牌组，然后像往常一样组成奇遇。",
	"The twins could be a pair of (%0%) or a (%1%) with two pet (%2%) (with the two hell hounds represented by a single card). Because you're more likely to draw both twin cards when the encounter deck has thinned out, the twin encounter should make for a climactic battle. Each twin should have a challenge rating about equal to the characters' level.": "双胞胎可能是一对 (%0%) 或一个 (%1%) 带着两个宠物 (%2%)（两只地狱猎犬由一张卡牌代表）。因为当遭遇战卡组变薄时，你更有可能抽到两张双胞胎卡牌，所以双胞胎遭遇战应该是一场高潮迭起的战斗。每张孪生卡的挑战等级应与角色等级相当。",
	"When you draw this card, discard it and draw two more. Don't return this card to the deck. You can also include a \"draw three\" card or even a \"draw four\" card.": "抽到这张牌时，弃掉它，再抽两张。不要将这张牌放回卡组。您还可以加入一张 \"抽三 \"牌，甚至一张 \"抽四 \"牌。",
	"You can add cards to represent creatures you don't expect the characters to fight, such as a peaceful (%0%), or scenes the characters might find, like a mysterious statue. When you draw one of these cards, decide whether to use it as the encounter or to build an encounter using the remaining cards.": "您可以添加一些卡片来代表您不希望角色与之交战的生物，例如和平（%0%），或者角色可能会发现的场景，例如神秘的雕像。当您抽到其中一张牌时，请决定是用它作为奇遇，还是用其余的牌来建立一个奇遇。",
	"You can also include one or more cards in an encounter deck to represent goals for the characters as they explore a region. For example, a goal card might represent an ancient ruin the characters are seeking. When that card appears, the adventurers find the site. A goal card could also represent a creature the characters are searching for.": "您还可以在奇遇卡组中加入一张或多张卡牌，代表角色在探索某个地区时的目标。例如，一张目标牌可能代表角色正在寻找的古代遗迹。当这张牌出现时，冒险者们就找到了遗址。目标牌也可以代表角色正在寻找的生物。",
	"You don't want a goal to show up right away. If you draw a goal card earlier than you want, give the adventurers only a hint of the goal's presence: perhaps the monsters they encounter are hunting the same creature, and its tracks can still be found. Or the encounter might take place within an ancient construction similar to the ruin they're searching for. Draw a replacement for the goal card, and shuffle the goal card into the deck. You might allow the goal to elude the characters twice before they finally reach it.": "你不希望目标马上出现。如果你提前抽到了目标卡牌，那么只需要给冒险者一点提示，让他们知道目标的存在：也许他们遇到的怪物正在猎杀同一种生物，而且还能找到它的踪迹。或者，他们可能会在一个与他们正在寻找的废墟相似的古代建筑中遭遇。抽取目标牌的替代牌，然后将目标牌洗入牌组。你可以让角色在最终达到目标之前两次躲避目标。",
	"Another way to handle a goal is to omit the goal card from the deck at the beginning of the session and shuffle it in when the characters reach a particular milestone. For example, suppose the goal is to defeat a (%0%) responsible for raiding nearby villages. There might be four ordinary (%1%) (minions of the fang of Yeenoghu) in the encounter deck. Once the characters have killed three of the minions, shuffle the goal card in. That way, the characters always meet the minions first.": "处理目标的另一种方法是在游戏开始时将目标卡从卡组中省略，当角色达到特定的里程碑时再将其洗入卡组。例如，假设目标是打败负责袭击附近村庄的 (%0%)。奇遇卡组中可能有四个普通的 (%1%)（耶诺古獠牙的爪牙）。一旦角色杀死了三个爪牙，就把目标卡洗进去。这样，角色总是先遇到小喽啰。",
	"The goal card might also be one of a pair of twin cards, which both increases the chance that characters will find it later in their exploration and ensures that a specific creature (the other twin card) is always encountered with the goal.": "目标卡也可能是一对孪生卡中的一张，这样既能增加角色在探索过程中找到目标卡的几率，又能确保在找到目标卡时总会遇到特定的生物（另一张孪生卡）。",
	"Evolving your encounter deck fosters a sense of progress, creating a rough narrative arc as the adventurers explore an area. You can evolve the deck to make encounters progressively harder, or you can change the flavor of encounters, such as adding creatures from a particular environment.": "在冒险者探索一个区域的过程中，进化你的奇遇卡组可以培养一种进步感，创造一个粗略的叙事弧线。您可以进化卡组，使奇遇的难度逐渐增加，也可以改变奇遇的风味，比如加入特定环境中的生物。",
	"One way to accomplish this is to build two encounter decks. Draw cards from the first encounter deck, and when you remove cards from that deck, replace those cards with an equal number of random cards from the second deck. This method is particularly effective if the second deck has a markedly different theme. You might start with an encounter deck featuring mostly dungeon scavengers, like (%0%) and (%1%), then slowly add in cards from a deck made up of Undead creatures and cultists.": "实现这一目标的方法之一是建立两个奇遇牌组。从第一套奇遇卡组中抽牌，当你从这套卡组中抽牌时，用第二套卡组中相同数量的随机牌来替换这些牌。如果第二副牌的主题明显不同，这种方法就特别有效。一开始，你可能会用一个主要以地牢清道夫为主题的奇遇卡组，比如 (%0%) 和 (%1%)，然后慢慢从一个由亡灵生物和邪教徒组成的卡组中加入卡牌。",
	"Alternatively, you can use special cards such as noncombat encounter cards to tell you when to begin shuffling in cards from the second deck. For example, adventurers exploring a sylvan woodland might encounter mostly elves and Fey, but you might include a noncombat encounter card representing the party's discovery of a scorched clearing. After that encounter, you can start shuffling in cards representing gnolls and (%0%)—the cause of the destruction.": "另外，你也可以使用非战斗奇遇卡等特殊卡牌来告诉你何时开始从第二副牌洗牌。例如，探险者在探索一片森林时可能会遇到大部分精灵和费伊，但你可以加入一张非战斗奇遇卡，代表探险队发现了一片被烧焦的空地。在那次遭遇战之后，你就可以开始洗入代表地精和 (%0%) - 破坏原因的卡牌了。",
	"If you have a goal card (see the \"(%0%)\" section above), you don't want the adventurers to reach the goal too early; don't put that card into the deck until the characters defeat one or more creatures from the second deck. At that point, shuffle the goal card into the second deck.": "如果你有一张目标牌（见上文\"(%0%) \"部分），你不希望冒险者们过早达到目标；在角色们击败第二副牌中的一个或多个生物之前，不要将这张牌放入牌组。这时，将目标牌洗入第二副牌。",
	"These sample decks, best suited for 4th- to 6th-level characters, feature monsters from the (%0%) and (%1%). If you don't have (%2%), omit those cards from the deck.": "这些样本卡组最适合 4 到 6 级的角色使用，以 (%0%) 和 (%1%) 中的怪物为特色。如果您没有 (%2%)，请从卡组中省略这些卡牌。",
	"Entries with a multiplication sign indicate that the card represents multiple monsters. Monsters in the same group are assigned cards with the same face value (for example, all bandits are represented by king cards), but not all monsters with the same value are a group (the (%0%), for example, hunt alone). This makes it easier to see when you've drawn multiple cards that form an encounter.": "带有乘号的条目表示该卡代表多个怪物。同一组中的怪物会分配到面值相同的卡片（例如，所有强盗都由国王卡代表），但并非所有面值相同的怪物都是一组（例如，（%0%）单独狩猎）。这样，当您抽到的多张牌组成一个奇遇时，就更容易看出来了。",
	"You can use these decks as examples for building your own. You can use them separately when the characters are traveling through suitable terrain, or you can combine them (see \"(%0%)\" above), so characters who are exploring a forest (using the forest encounter deck) slowly discover the vile demonic influence corrupting the place as you shuffle in cards from the corrupted lands encounter deck.": "您可以使用这些卡组作为范例来制作自己的卡组。当角色穿越合适的地形时，可以单独使用这些卡组，也可以将它们组合起来（见上文\"(%0%)\"），这样当角色探索森林（使用森林奇遇卡组）时，就会慢慢发现腐化之地奇遇卡组中的卡牌正腐蚀着这里的邪恶魔力。",

If a guessed card is one of the cards in the ghost's hand but is in the wrong slot, an orb turns blue. The characters can use this information to make another guess by placing four more cards in the next row down.": "要进行第一次猜谜，角色必须将四张牌放入棋盘第一行的空槽中。幽灵手中可能有四张不同的牌，也可能有两张或多张相同的牌。如果该行中的牌是正确插槽中的正确牌，则该行旁边的球体会变成红色。如果猜中的牌是幽灵手中的牌之一，但放在了错误的插槽中，则球体会变成蓝色。角色可以利用这些信息，在下一行再放四张牌，从而再次猜中。",
	"There are ten rows for cards, meaning the characters have ten chances to correctly guess the ghost's hand. If they guess the hand in fewer than ten tries, they win a treasure of your choice. If the characters find the solution in six or fewer guesses, the ghost tells them of an even greater treasure buried at a distant adventure location.": "纸牌共有十排，这意味着角色有十次机会猜对幽灵的手牌。如果他们猜中的次数少于十次，他们就会赢得你选择的宝藏。如果角色在六次或更少的猜测中找到答案，鬼魂就会告诉他们在遥远的探险地点埋藏着更大的宝藏。",

	"Few things are more enticing than a rare item with magical properties hidden behind a riddle. Items have the added benefit of being portable, allowing the characters to ponder a confounding curio during short rests or while traveling.

In this case, the Knight card could portend a friendly warrior whom the character will soon meet—and who could become a loyal ally.": "%0%）详细说明了由（%1%）的骑士牌召唤的非玩家角色是如何出现的。但正如（%2%）中所讨论的，（%3%）中的牌可以解释为指向未来事件的叙事方向。在这种情况下，骑士牌可能预示着一个友好的战士，角色很快就会遇到他，而且他可能会成为忠实的盟友。",
	"When the Knight card is used as a narrative device in this way, the ally it brings isn't magically summoned or compelled to obey the characters; the deck has merely foretold the ally's imminent arrival. Consider what motivates this ally to accompany the party. This ally could be new or familiar to the characters, and the ally might be repaying a favor or pursuing goals of their own.": "当骑士牌以这种方式用作叙事手段时，它带来的盟友并不是魔法召唤来的，也不是被迫服从角色的；牌面只是预言了盟友即将到来。考虑一下是什么促使这位盟友随行。这个盟友对角色来说可能是新的，也可能是熟悉的；盟友可能是为了报恩，也可能是为了追求自己的目标。",
	"Several kinds of allies are described below, each with a different reason for accompanying the party. Guidance on when the ally might depart is also provided. An ally who befriends the characters might linger in the story long after the ally's personal goals have been accomplished (especially if the players enjoy that NPC). If you're using (%0%) card set to foretell the future, boxed text for each ally provides dialogue a fortune teller might use to tell characters of the ally's imminent arrival.": "下文介绍了几种盟友，每种盟友都有不同的陪伴理由。此外，还提供了关于盟友何时离开的指导。与角色交好的盟友可能会在盟友的个人目标完成后继续留在故事中很长时间（尤其是如果玩家喜欢这个 NPC）。如果您使用（%0%）卡组来预言未来，那么每个盟友的方框文字都会提供算命先生可能会使用的对话，告诉角色盟友即将到来。",
	"Whatever type of ally you choose, the party should encounter this ally soon after drawing the card—within a few days or even sooner.": "无论选择哪种类型的盟友，一行人都应该在抽取卡片后不久--几天内甚至更早--就遇到这位盟友。",
	"Your good deeds shall be rewarded; gratitude becomes guardianship.": "你的善行会得到回报，感恩会成为守护。",
	"This ally is grateful to the characters; perhaps the characters saved the ally's life or helped the ally in a significant way. This is an especially good way to bring back an ally the characters liked but left behind in their adventures. The ally accompanies the characters until the ally considers their debt repaid, perhaps by saving a character's life.": "这位盟友会对角色心存感激；也许角色救了盟友的命，或者以一种重要的方式帮助了盟友。这是让角色喜欢但在冒险中遗落的盟友回来的一个特别好的方法。盟友会一直陪伴着角色，直到盟友认为他们欠下的债已经还清，也许是救了角色的命。",
	"If the ally is someone the characters already know, the fortune teller might hint at the ally's appearance or name.": "如果盟友是角色已经认识的人，算命先生可能会暗示盟友的外貌或名字。",
	"Find the one who searches; you need not look far, and both of you will benefit.": "找到寻找的那个人；你们不需要找得太远，你们双方都会受益。",
	"This ally hopes to find someone or something in a place the characters are going to. The object of the ally's quest is of utmost importance—such as a family member, a lost heirloom, or an ingredient for an obscure ritual. The ally remains with the characters until the ally can emerge safely from danger with the person or item they're seeking. If the ally is seeking a magic item hidden deep in a dungeon, for example, the ally helps the adventurers complete their mission after finding the item.": "盟友希望在角色要去的地方找到某人或某物。盟友寻找的目标非常重要，例如家人、遗失的传家宝或晦涩仪式的材料。盟友会一直与角色在一起，直到盟友带着他们要找的人或物品安全脱险。例如，如果盟友在寻找隐藏在地牢深处的魔法物品，盟友会在找到物品后帮助冒险者完成任务。",
	"The fortune teller might hint at the person or thing the ally is seeking.": "算命先生可能会暗示盟友正在寻找的人或物。",
	"Knowledge is power, and someone who chases knowledge shall seek you out.": "知识就是力量，追逐知识的人一定会找到你。",
	"This ally wishes to study a particular dungeon, region, or creature. The ally might be a historian, planar explorer, botanist, or zoologist. Because the Knight card usually summons a warrior, a studious ally might be a bit of a surprise for the characters—someone they dismiss as unrelated to the (%0%) until the scholar draws a weapon and ably defends themself in battle. The studious ally remains with the characters as long as there are more secrets to learn; when the characters leave the region the ally is interested in, the ally amiably parts ways with them.": "盟友希望研究某个地牢、地区或生物。盟友可能是历史学家、星球探险家、植物学家或动物学家。因为骑士牌通常会召唤一名战士，所以好学的盟友可能会让角色们感到有些意外--他们会认为这个人与（%0%）无关，直到这位学者拔出武器并在战斗中为自己辩护。只要有更多的秘密需要了解，好学的盟友就会一直与角色在一起；当角色离开盟友感兴趣的地区时，盟友就会友好地与他们分道扬镳。",

	"This ally shares a common enemy with the characters. The ally had someone or something taken from them by a terrible monster or villain—someone the characters also oppose or soon will. Now, the ally hopes to slay that villain or bring it to justice, accompanying the characters until this task is done.": "这个盟友与角色有共同的敌人。盟友的某个人或某样东西被一个可怕的怪物或恶棍夺走了--这个人也是角色的对手，或者很快就会成为角色的对手。现在，盟友希望杀死那个恶棍或将其绳之以法，并陪伴角色直到完成任务。",
	"The fortune teller might be able to divine who this common enemy is, even if the characters haven't yet encountered that foe.": "算命先生也许能占卜出谁是这个共同的敌人，即使角色们还没有遇到这个敌人。",
	"Allies are an important part of any adventuring party's career. However, whenever an ally joins the party for a significant amount of time, it's important the ally doesn't overshadow the player characters. Here are some ways to keep the party feeling like heroes, even when the cast of characters grows.": "盟友是任何冒险队生涯的重要组成部分。然而，每当盟友加入队伍的时间较长时，重要的是盟友的光芒不能盖过玩家角色。以下是一些方法，即使角色人数增加，也能让队伍保持英雄的感觉。",
	"Sometimes our paths cross with others' in the most fortuitous ways, bringing us allies and even friends. And though our lives may eventually diverge from theirs, that doesn't make the friendships any less meaningful.": "有时，我们的人生道路会与他人的人生道路产生最偶然的交集，为我们带来盟友，甚至是朋友。虽然我们的生活最终可能会与他们的生活产生分歧，但这并不会让友谊变得不那么有意义。",
	"Consider letting your players control the ally. This can be a great way to keep more players involved if the party splits; when any player's usual character isn't present in a scene, they play the ally instead. It's helpful to give the ally a couple of distinguishing personality traits or mannerisms—such as greed, a love of beer, or a favorite expression—to make it easier to roleplay the ally on a moment's notice.": "考虑让你的玩家控制盟友。如果队伍分裂，这是一个让更多玩家参与进来的好方法；当任何玩家的常用角色不在场景中时，他们就扮演盟友。给盟友赋予一些与众不同的个性特征或举止--比如贪婪、爱喝啤酒或最喜欢的表达方式--会很有帮助，这样就能让盟友更容易在不经意间扮演角色。",
	"If you don't want the players to have the ally's character sheet or stat block, you can ask them what they'd like the ally to do and fulfill their requests. The ally might be eager for instruction, dutifully carrying out orders in the heat of battle. This is especially useful for allies who serve as the bodyguard for a wizard character or who partner with a rogue character to help the rogue perform sneak attacks. In this case, you can explain the ally's capabilities to the players so that the party can best use the ally.": "如果不想让玩家拥有盟友的角色表或状态块，可以询问他们希望盟友做什么，并满足他们的要求。盟友可能渴望得到指示，在激烈的战斗中尽职尽责地执行命令。这对于担任巫师角色保镖或与流氓角色搭档帮助流氓进行偷袭的盟友来说尤其有用。在这种情况下，你可以向玩家解释盟友的能力，以便玩家能够更好地使用盟友。",
	"Players can feel undervalued if an ally is outperforming their characters. While an overly powerful ally is fine on rare occasion, the players should still feel like their characters are the true heroes of the story.": "如果盟友的表现超过了玩家的角色，玩家就会觉得自己的角色被低估了。虽然在极少数情况下，盟友过于强大也没什么问题，但玩家仍应觉得自己的角色才是故事中真正的英雄。",
	"If you're building the ally as if it were a character, keep the ally 1 or 2 levels below the characters. If you're using a monster stat block instead, make sure its hit points and damage output aren't outpacing the characters', and be wary of powerful monster abilities, skill proficiencies, and spellcasting.": "如果你把盟友当作角色来打造，那么盟友的等级要比角色低 1 到 2 级。如果你使用的是怪物状态块，要确保怪物的命中率和伤害输出不会超过角色，同时要警惕强大的怪物能力、技能熟练度和咒语。",
	"One way to avoid overshadowing the characters is to create an ally who has skills and abilities that complement the party's. Healing, tracking, and proficiency with thieves' tools (to disarm traps and unlock doors) are common examples of such skills. A group without magical healing isn't going to complain when an NPC cleric joins their party, so long as the cleric focuses on healing!": "避免角色黯然失色的方法之一是创建一个拥有与角色互补的技能和能力的盟友。治疗、追踪和精通盗贼工具（拆除陷阱和开锁）就是这类技能的常见例子。一个没有魔法治疗的团队不会因为 NPC 牧师的加入而抱怨，只要牧师专注于治疗！",
	"Similarly, you can give an ally abilities that bolster or otherwise support the characters without dealing damage on their own, such as the (%0%) spell or Bardic Inspiration. Perhaps the ally prefers to use the (%1%) action, and if a character's ability check or attack succeeds with the ally's help, the ally grants an additional benefit. These tactics keep the spotlight on the characters, with the ally providing valuable support.": "同样，你也可以赋予盟友一些能力，例如 (%0%) 法术或吟游诗人灵感，这些能力可以增强或以其他方式支持角色，而不会对其本身造成伤害。也许盟友更喜欢使用 (%1%) 行动，如果角色的能力检定或攻击在盟友的帮助下成功，盟友就会给予额外的好处。这些策略让角色成为焦点，而盟友则提供宝贵的支持。",
	"In larger parties, adding an ally can slow down combat. Consider having the ally tag along for only a session or two, or limit the encounters they appear in. Maybe the ally helps the characters in only a certain region or part of town and then leaves to attend to other duties. The important thing is that the ally is available when the characters want them and retreats into the background when the characters don't want or need the help.": "在人数较多的队伍中，增加一名盟友可能会减慢战斗速度。可以考虑让盟友只跟随一两次，或者限制他们出现的场合。也许盟友只在某个区域或城镇的某个地方帮助角色，然后就离开去处理其他任务。重要的是，当角色需要时，盟友就会出现，而当角色不想要或不需要帮助时，盟友就会退居幕后。",
	"Consider ways the ally could help the characters off-screen. The ally could defend the characters' base of operations from intruders while the characters are off adventuring. Or the ally might complete tedious side quests for the characters, gather valuable loot or information, or resolve old problems the characters have forgotten about or left behind.": "考虑盟友在屏幕外帮助角色的方式。当角色外出冒险时，盟友可以保护角色的行动基地不被入侵。或者，盟友可以为角色完成乏味的支线任务，收集有价值的战利品或信息，或者解决角色已经遗忘或留下的老问题。",

	"Created from the multifaceted magic of a (%0%), a deck defender obeys the commands of the character who drew the Knight card. It can assume multiple shapes. When summoned, a deck defender first appears in its protective guardian form, bearing a folded sword and shield. The character who summoned the deck defender can fold it into the more threatening berserker form or the nimble acrobat form, as desired.": "卡组防御者由 (%0%) 的多面魔法创造而成，服从抽取骑士卡的角色的命令。它可以有多种形态。召唤时，卡组防御者首先以保护守护者的形态出现，手持折叠的剑和盾牌。召唤卡组防御者的角色可以根据需要将其折叠成更具威胁性的狂战士形态或灵活的杂技演员形态。",
	"No matter what form a deck defender takes, its card-like nature makes it fragile. When a deck defender is defeated, it collapses into a pile of nonmagical cards.": "无论卡组防御者以何种形式出现，其类似卡片的性质都会使其变得脆弱。当卡组防御者被击败时，它会坍塌成一堆非魔法卡牌。",
	"This chapter details the Solar Bastion, a benevolent organization that protects the multiverse from the chaos wrought by the (%0%).

	"Founded by Hilarion, a solar angel, the Solar Bastion uses the sun as its symbol. Typically, this symbol is styled to evoke the Sun card in a (%0%), reflecting both the knights' origin and their mission in the multiverse. Sometimes knights wear this symbol openly on their gear, but more often they keep a sun-shaped pin hidden under a collar or lapel or carry a nonmagical copy of the Sun card to identify their allegiance when necessary.": "太阳堡垒由太阳天使希拉里翁创立，以太阳作为其标志。通常情况下，这个标志的造型会让人联想到（%0%）中的太阳卡，反映出骑士们的起源和他们在多元宇宙中的使命。有时，骑士们会在装备上公开佩戴这个标志，但更多的时候，他们会在领口或衣襟下藏一个太阳形状的别针，或者随身携带一张非魔法的太阳卡副本，以便在必要时识别他们的效忠对象。",
	"The Solar Bastion monitors the (%0%) in all its manifestations throughout the multiverse, warns and protects those who find it, and minimizes the damage it causes when found.

	"Because the knights' resources are spread thin, the Solar Bastion welcomes assistance. A knight might recruit help for a mission that's too difficult to handle alone, but more often a knight opportunistically joins forces with adventurers, offering help with the party's efforts as long as their goals align. Often, the adventurers in these arrangements have no knowledge of the knight's true allegiance, and the knight rarely explains the Solar Bastion's purpose unless that information is relevant.": "由于骑士们的资源分散，太阳堡垒欢迎援助。骑士可能会招募帮手来完成一个人难以完成的任务，但更常见的情况是，骑士会不失时机地与冒险者联手，只要他们的目标一致，骑士就会为冒险者提供帮助。通常情况下，这些安排中的冒险者并不知道骑士的真正效忠对象，而骑士也很少解释太阳堡垒的目的，除非是相关的信息。",

	"A powerful and immortal Celestial, Hilarion sees no reason for additional tiers of leadership in the organization.

	"Seven tall watchtowers ring the edge of the Solar Bastion. In addition to offering a clear view of the entire fortress, the towers are equipped with magical devices that give their sentries the ability to detect threats approaching the bastion and even to peer into other planes of existence. Knights of the Solar Bastion usually stay in one of the Towers of Day while visiting the fortress, and while they're there, they also serve as sentries.

He considers protection rackets, smuggling, and arson to be low-hanging fruit, with extortion, kidnapping, and murder for hire being more complex challenges the guild can take on as it grows in power. His only real fear is exposure; the bigger and more active the Moonstalkers become, the more likely they are to attract the attention of law enforcement or adventurous do-gooders. The sting of the guild's flight from its first home is still fresh in Delour's mind.": "德卢尔的想法是将公会的活动扩展到偷窃之外。他研究了其他犯罪集团及其致富方法。他认为敲诈勒索、走私和纵火是最容易得手的手段，而勒索、绑架和雇凶杀人则是随着公会势力的壮大可以应对的更复杂的挑战。他唯一真正害怕的是暴露身份；\"月行者 \"的规模越大、活动越频繁，就越有可能引起执法部门或冒险家的注意。德鲁尔对公会逃离第一个家园的痛苦记忆犹新。",

She has a short temper and no patience for new recruits, but she rarely loses her cool when it counts.": "由于老大们大部分时间都在月行者的公会大厅里与有权势的客户进行策划和谈判，因此大多数公会成员与凯瑟拉相处的时间远远多于与德鲁尔或奥古斯都相处的时间。她训练成员，领导高优先级的任务，总是希望她的同伙能像她一样提供专业精准的服务。她脾气暴躁，对新成员没有耐心，但在关键时刻她很少失去冷静。",

	"Alternatively, if the characters are looking to steal something (for instance, as part of an adventure from (%0%)), Moonstalkers might try to secure that same item for a different employer.

	"Wanewort uses her hag magic to communicate with the character in a dream. She explains she works for a man who has many magical treasures and powerful connections, and he wants an audience with the character.

	"The Moonstalkers don't always do their own dirty work. When a mission is too time-consuming, challenging, or simple, the guild assigns it to other criminals or to aspiring guild members. Even if your characters aren't evil, they might find themselves working for or alongside the Moonstalkers on an odd job. Perhaps both groups have a mutual enemy. Maybe the Moonstalkers learned the characters will be delving into a particular dungeon and ask the party to retrieve a specific piece of treasure. Perhaps the Moonstalkers extort the characters or refuse to divulge key information unless the characters do their bidding. Maybe the Moonstalkers offer so much money or such enticing magic items that the characters find collaboration hard to refuse.": "潜月者并不总是自己干脏活累活。当任务过于耗时、具有挑战性或简单时，公会就会将其分配给其他罪犯或有抱负的公会成员。即使你的角色并不邪恶，他们也可能会发现自己在为月行者工作或与月行者并肩作战。也许这两个组织有共同的敌人。也许 \"月行者 \"得知角色们将深入某个地牢，于是要求他们取回一件特定的宝物。也许 \"月行者 \"会敲诈角色，或者拒绝透露关键信息，除非角色听从他们的命令。也许 \"月行者 \"会提供大量金钱或诱人的魔法物品，让角色难以拒绝。",
	"Those hoping for guild membership (sometimes called \"crescents\") must complete three jobs for the Moonstalkers to be initiated into the guild. Crescents can work together, in which case the mission counts for all of them. Each job is more difficult than the last, and the final job always requires the crescent to take a life, usually the life of a guard or witness to the crime. The Moonstalkers then reward the crescent with lycanthropy, initiating them as a full member. Here are examples of missions the Moonstalkers might assign a crescent, in order of increasing difficulty:": "希望成为公会成员的人（有时被称为 \"新月人\"）必须为月行者完成三项任务才能加入公会。新成员可以一起工作，在这种情况下，任务对他们所有人都有效。每一个任务都比上一个任务更难，最后一个任务总是要求新月争取一条人命，通常是守卫或犯罪目击者的性命。然后，月行者会奖励新月成为狼人，让他们成为正式成员。以下是月行者可能分配给新月的任务示例，难度依次递增：",

Identifying the substance requires skill, and it might be poisonous or spoil quickly, so the thief must hurry to deliver the goods on time.": "瓦妮沃特让角色从危险的小树林或某人的花园中收集一种材料，用于她的仪式。鉴别这种物质需要技巧，而且它可能有毒或很快变质，因此小偷必须抓紧时间准时交货。",
	"The character must delve into a dungeon, a holy crypt, or a noble's treasury and steal a particular item. All sorts of monsters might lurk in such a place, from Undead to inhabitants of the Underdark, but they aren't all hostile, and the character might be able to sneak past them.": "角色必须深入地牢、圣墓或贵族的宝库，偷取特定物品。在这样的地方可能潜伏着各种怪物，从亡灵到幽暗世界的居民，但它们并不都是敌对的，角色也许可以偷偷溜过去。",

With a ceremonial bite from another Moonstalker, the crescents become fully initiated guild members.": "完成三个任务的新月兽会得到老大的祝贺，然后老大会决定新月兽将成为哪种狼人。只要被另一名月行者咬一口，新月兽就会成为正式的公会成员。",

	"Those who don't accept the teachings of the Heralds of the Comet are doomed to destruction, and they deserve pity. Initiates are taught to warn outsiders to ready themselves for the coming destruction. Many initiates are fundamentally kindhearted and try to help outsiders when they can, but they ultimately come to believe most outsiders are lost causes, too attached to the world as it is.": "不接受彗星先驱者教诲的人注定要毁灭，他们值得同情。启蒙者被教导警告外来者为即将到来的毁灭做好准备。许多启蒙者心地善良，在力所能及的情况下会尽力帮助外来者，但他们最终会认为大多数外来者都是迷途者，他们过于依恋这个世界的现状。",
	"The comet that presages the end is called the All-Consuming Star. It is a manifestation of the Void that moves through the multiverse, devouring worlds and entire planes. The end of all things will be the culmination of the All-Consuming Star's work.": "预示末日的彗星被称为 \"万噬星\"。它是虚空的化身，在多元宇宙中穿梭，吞噬着各个世界和整个位面。万物的终结将是万噬星工作的顶点。",

	"The Heralds of the Comet is a small, close-knit community. Through the process of severing their ties to the doomed world, members become entirely dependent on the group and its leaders for social interaction, material support, and the fulfillment of spiritual needs.

	"The Heralds of the Comet seeks recruits to swell the group's ranks. Initiates believe they have a moral imperative to rescue as many people as possible from the coming destruction of the multiverse, so they see recruitment as an act of mercy.

	"Those drawn to this message are called aspirants. Each aspirant meets regularly with an initiate mentor, who teaches the aspirant the fundamental tenets of the Heralds of the Comet and performs divinatory card readings for them. These readings purport to help the aspirant work through personal issues, but the readings all point to the same conclusion: the world is dying, and the Heralds of the Comet offers the only way to endure its destruction. Aspirants are sometimes called Jesters, in reference to the card of that name, while outsiders are called Fools.": "被这一信息吸引的人被称为有志者。每个有抱负的人都会定期与一位启蒙导师见面，导师会向有抱负的人传授彗星先驱的基本信条，并为他们占卜看牌。这些占卜旨在帮助有抱负的人解决个人问题，但占卜结果都指向同一个结论：世界正在毁灭，而彗星先驱会提供了唯一能让人忍受毁灭的方法。有抱负的人有时会被称为 \"小丑\"（Jesters），这与同名的牌有关，而外来者则被称为 \"愚人\"（Fools）。",
	"Aspirants are encouraged to give generously to the Heralds of the Comet to support its work. They're also encouraged to cut from their lives any people who might hold back their progress toward enlightenment. Aspirants thus gradually come to see the Heralds of the Comet as their sole source of truth and friendship.": "我们鼓励有志者慷慨解囊，支持彗星先驱的工作。他们还被鼓励从生活中剔除任何可能阻碍他们走向觉悟的人。因此，有志之士逐渐将彗星先驱视为真理和友谊的唯一源泉。",

	"Warnings leave fear and uncertainty in their wake. An individual might take desperate measures to persuade others to take such a warning seriously, or seize property and goods from others to prepare for the disaster to come. The resulting chaos creates an opening for opportunistic evil organizations to increase their activities at a time when law enforcement and governments are stretched thin. A whole campaign could take place in the shadow of an apocalyptic comet, before the disaster it foretells even comes to pass.": "警告会带来恐惧和不确定性。个人可能会铤而走险，说服他人认真对待这样的警告，或者夺取他人的财产和物品，为即将到来的灾难做好准备。由此造成的混乱为投机取巧的邪恶组织提供了可乘之机，使其在执法部门和政府捉襟见肘的时候增加活动。在彗星预示的灾难到来之前，整个活动就可能在世界末日彗星的阴影下发生。",
	"Once the warning has been delivered, can the calamity it foreshadows be averted? Typically, the answer is yes—that's the point of giving a warning.

Alternatively, your campaign could be about rebuilding society after the disaster, prompting survivors to question beliefs and actions that led to such overwhelming destruction.": "这可能会为以人们在灾难后挣扎求生为主题的活动奠定基础。或者，您的活动可以是灾后社会重建，促使幸存者质疑导致如此巨大破坏的信仰和行为。",
	"In the middle of a campaign, a disaster like this signals a major shift. If the apocalypse is preceded by warnings, the campaign might first focus on the characters' efforts to avert the catastrophe; then on mitigating the disaster; and finally on surviving, rebuilding, or escaping to another world.": "在活动的中期，这样的灾难预示着重大的转变。如果在世界末日来临之前已经发出了警告，那么活动的重点可能首先是角色努力避免灾难，然后是减轻灾难，最后是生存、重建或逃往另一个世界。",

The stars that form the constellation suggest embracing figures or, in more chaste circles, a pair of hands pressed palms together.

When portrayed as a person, the Flames takes up with the Rogue, contributing to the belief that opposites attract.": "在火焰座（又称情人座）下，脾气和激情会燃烧起来。组成该星座的星星暗示着相拥的身影，或者在更贞洁的圈子里，暗示着一双手掌紧紧地贴在一起。在神话故事中，恋人们对 \"利爪 \"感到厌烦，宁愿与宝石进行悲剧性的交易。当被描绘成一个人时，火焰座会与流氓座搭上关系，这也是异性相吸的说法的由来。",

Gremorly performed a ritual that turned Sovereign Keep into a ghost trap: anyone who dies within the castle walls rises as an incorporeal spirit, trapped within the castle. Then, he waited. When adventurers came to investigate the seemingly abandoned keep, Gremorly murdered them and trapped their ghosts. But fortune recently turned against Gremorly when a behir entered the keep seeking a nest. It slew Gremorly, who became a victim of his own ritual.": "多年前，一个名叫格雷莫里的巫师从（%0%）中抽到了王座牌，获得了一座名为 \"君主城堡 \"的小城堡的所有权。格雷莫里是一个亡灵巫师，也是一个厌世者，他对活人没有什么耐心；他决心利用这座城堡来创造和容纳一支幽灵军队，用来夺取权力。格雷莫里举行了一个仪式，将主权城堡变成了一个鬼魂陷阱：任何死在城堡围墙内的人都会化为无形的灵魂复活，被困在城堡里。然后，他等待着。当冒险者们前来调查这座看似废弃的城堡时，格雷莫里杀害了他们，并困住了他们的鬼魂。但最近，当一只贝希尔进入城堡寻找巢穴时，命运却与格雷莫里背道而驰。它杀死了格雷莫利，格雷莫利也成了自己仪式的牺牲品。",
	"Gremorly is now one of the many ghosts that haunt the keep. Locals have renamed the keep Harrowhall, as they dread the spectral figures moving through the fog there and the fierce lightning storms that erupt without warning. (The behir is the source of this lightning, but the locals don't know that.)": "现在，格雷莫利已成为困扰着这座城堡的众多幽灵之一。当地人将城堡改名为哈罗霍尔，因为他们害怕在雾中穿梭的幽灵和毫无征兆地爆发的猛烈雷暴。(贝希尔就是闪电的来源，但当地人并不知道）。",
	"Harrowhall is designed to be a challenge for four 8th-level characters who explore the keep in a single session. Decrease the challenge for characters lower than 8th level. Conversely, increase the challenge for groups with more than four characters, with characters higher than 8th level, or that revisit the keep over multiple sessions.": "哈罗霍尔的设计目的是让四名八级角色在一次会话中探索这座城堡。对于低于 8 级的角色，挑战难度会降低。反之，对于拥有四名以上角色、角色等级高于 8 级或多次重游该城堡的团队，挑战难度则会增加。",
	"If Harrowhall is too challenging for your group, but you want the characters to have a keep, you can use these strategies to decrease the difficulty:": "如果哈罗霍尔对你的团队来说太具有挑战性，但你又想让角色们有一个保留地，你可以使用这些策略来降低难度：",
	"When the characters agree to aid a group of ghosts, those ghosts grant each character (%0%) (%1%), in a manner similar to a 4th-level casting of the (%2%) spell.": "当角色同意帮助一群鬼魂时，这些鬼魂会赋予每个角色 (%0%) (%1%) 的能力，其方式类似于 4 级施放 (%2%) 法术。",
	"Reduce the number of (%0%) and (%1%) in the keep, using the rules for (%2%) in the (%3%) to create an appropriate challenge.": "减少（%0%）和（%1%）的数量，利用（%3%）中（%2%）的规则，提出适当的挑战。",

	"If the characters end Gremorly's ghost trap ritual, he immediately departs for his eternal rest, along with most of the other ghosts.": "如果角色们结束了格雷莫里的鬼魂陷阱仪式，他就会立即和其他大多数鬼魂一起离开，进入永恒的安息。",
	"If Harrowhall isn't sufficiently challenging for your group, here are ways to make it more difficult:": "如果哈罗霍尔对您的团队来说还不够具有挑战性，那么有一些方法可以增加它的难度：",

Characters in the keep have disadvantage on death saving throws, and all forms of healing (including finishing short and long rests) restore only half as many hit points as usual.": "在探索过程中，幽灵般的阴暗会影响角色。堡垒中的角色在死亡蓄力时处于劣势，所有形式的治疗（包括短暂休息和长时间休息）都只能恢复平时一半的命中率。",
	"Introduce a countdown to keep the characters from taking too many short rests. Gremorly is trying to break his ritual with a new one that takes 3 hours to complete. The other ghosts know his plan and inform the characters of it. If the characters can't free the spirits in 3 hours, the new ritual fails disastrously, causing the entire castle to collapse.": "引入倒计时，防止角色休息时间过短。格雷莫里正试图用一个需要 3 小时才能完成的新仪式来打破他的仪式。其他鬼魂知道了他的计划，并通知了角色们。如果角色们不能在 3 小时内释放鬼魂，新仪式就会惨遭失败，导致整个城堡坍塌。",
	"The behir has attracted a mate to its nest. Alternatively, you can supplement the behir with its spawn: less powerful versions of the creature that are Large instead of Huge.": "贝希尔吸引了一个伴侣来到它的巢穴。另外，您也可以用贝希尔的卵子来补充贝希尔：这些卵子是贝希尔的低等生物，它们的体型是 \"大型 \"而不是 \"巨大\"。",

	"Gremorly's ritual forces any Humanoid who dies within the keep to return as a ghost that's unable to pass beyond the keep's walls. The ritual can be broken by disassembling, moving, or destroying all three ritual rods, which the necromancer placed in the armory ((%0%)), the kitchen ((%1%)), and the observatory ((%2%)). Each rod is protected by a (%3%). Once the ghost trap is broken, all the ghosts in the keep can leave except Gremorly, who remains to haunt the observatory.": "格雷莫里的仪式会迫使任何死在城堡里的人形生物化作幽灵返回，而幽灵无法越过城堡的围墙。仪式可以通过拆卸、移动或摧毁死灵法师放置在军械库（(%0%)）、厨房（(%1%)）和天文台（(%2%)）的三根仪式棒来打破。每根棒子都有（%3%）保护。一旦鬼魂陷阱被打破，除了格雷莫里之外，城堡里的所有鬼魂都可以离开，格雷莫里会继续在天文台出没。",
	"When the characters first arrive at Harrowhall, a thick and unsettling fog covers the grounds and many of the castle's rooms. The fog is a side effect of the ritual. As long as Gremorly's ritual remains in effect, the keep remains cold, foggy, and inhospitable.": "当人物第一次来到哈罗霍尔时，浓雾笼罩了整个场地和城堡的许多房间，令人不安。雾是仪式的副作用。只要格雷莫里的仪式一直有效，城堡就会一直寒冷、多雾、荒凉。",
	"Three groups of adventurers who dared to explore Harrowhall were killed by Gremorly and are now trapped in the keep. Fate's Devout are in the dining hall ((%0%)), the Spellseekers are in the eastern bedrooms ((%1%)), and the Gloved Hand are in the crypt ((%2%)). Each group can be customized to fit your campaign; for example, Fate's Devout might serve a prominent deity of fate in your setting, the Spellseekers might be Red Wizards of Thay, and the Gloved Hand might be Harpers.": "三组冒险者胆敢探索哈罗霍尔，却被格雷莫里杀死，现在被困在城堡里。命运虔诚者在饭厅（(%0%)），法术探寻者在东边的卧室（(%1%)），手套手在地窖（(%2%)）。每个小组都可以定制，以适应您的活动；例如，命运虔诚者可以为您设定中的某位著名命运之神服务，法术探寻者可以是泰伊的红袍巫师，手套手可以是哈珀人。",
	"The ghosts all hide from Gremorly. Although they know of the necromancer and the presence of other ghosts, they have forgotten most of what they knew in life, recalling little beyond the mission that brought them to the keep. The ghosts aren't hostile and act as allies to characters willing to help them. Destroying the ghosts is difficult, as they remain on the Border Ethereal and can't affect—or be affected by—anything on the Material Plane. The ghosts defend themselves if the characters attack them.": "鬼魂们都躲着格雷莫利。虽然他们知道亡灵巫师和其他鬼魂的存在，但他们已经忘记了生前所知道的大部分事情，除了把他们带到城堡的任务之外，他们几乎记不起其他事情。鬼魂并不敌对，而且是愿意帮助他们的角色的盟友。消灭幽灵是很困难的，因为它们仍然停留在虚无边界，无法影响物质界的任何事物，也不会被物质界的任何事物影响。如果角色攻击它们，幽灵会进行自卫。",
	"A (%0%) has made its nest in the keep's watchtower ((%1%)), but the monster hunts throughout the keep. Characters might spot it at any time, and it might test their strength in a brief encounter before retreating to attack again later. If the characters take their time and the adventure needs more excitement, the behir could attack and fight to the death.": "一只 (%0%) 在城堡的瞭望塔 ((%1%))中筑巢，但这只怪物会在整个城堡中狩猎。角色随时都有可能发现它，它可能会在短暂的遭遇战中测试他们的实力，然后撤退，稍后再发动攻击。如果角色慢慢来，而冒险又需要更多刺激，那么贝希尔可能会发动攻击并展开殊死搏斗。",
	"The behir knows the corridors of the keep so well that it can move through a 3-metre-wide space, as well as any door in the keep, without squeezing.": "贝希尔对城堡的走廊了如指掌，它可以在 3 米宽的空间里穿行，也可以在城堡的任何一扇门里穿行，而不会受到挤压。",

	"Before putting his necromantic plans in motion, Gremorly placed runes around the keep's outer walls that block certain kinds of divination magic. Creatures outside the keep's exterior walls can't scry into the keep. However, creatures inside the keep can scry inside it or beyond the walls. This effect lingers even if Gremorly's ritual ghost trap is dismantled.": "在实施他的亡灵魔法计划之前，格雷莫里在城堡外墙周围布下了符文，以阻挡某些占卜魔法。城堡外墙外的生物无法进入城堡进行占卜。但是，堡垒内的生物可以在堡垒内或堡垒外进行探查。即使格雷莫里的仪式幽灵陷阱被拆除，这种效果也不会消失。",

Read or paraphrase the following if the characters get close enough to see into the moat:": "哈罗霍尔周围有一道 9 米高的围墙，围墙周围是一条 6 米宽、4.5 米深的干护城河。吊桥放下，栅栏竖起。如果人物靠近护城河可以看到护城河，请阅读或转述以下内容：",

	"Gremorly dumped the corpses of those he killed into the moat. A character who examines these remains and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ((%0%)) check notices some skeletons have matching emblems on their clothing or gear, perhaps indicating the bearers belonged to the same organization. If you have decided the dead adventurers belonged to well-known organizations like the Harpers or Red Wizards of Thay, the symbols of those groups can be found among the corpses.": "格雷莫里将他杀死的人的尸体扔进了护城河。检查这些遗骸并成功通过 DC 15 智慧（(%0%)）检定的角色会注意到一些骸骨的衣服或装备上有匹配的徽章，这或许表明骸骨的主人属于同一个组织。如果您已经确定死去的冒险者属于著名的组织，比如哈珀人或泰伊的红袍巫师，那么可以在尸体中找到这些组织的标志。",

	"Set into a metal tripod in the center of the room is a 0.9-metre-long metal rod decorated with runes and glowing with necromantic magic. The entire assembly weighs 4 kilogramm. This is one of three rods Gremorly set up to turn Harrowhall into a ghost trap. If the rod is removed from its tripod or destroyed, the necromantic energy fades and the rod becomes nonmagical. The rod and tripod assembly has AC 19, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "房间中央的金属三脚架上插着一根 0.9 米长的金属棒，棒上饰有符文，并散发着亡灵魔法的光芒。整个装置重达 4 公斤。这是格雷莫里为了把哈罗霍尔变成幽灵陷阱而设置的三根棍子之一。如果将棒子从三脚架上取下或毁坏，亡灵魔法的能量就会消退，棒子就会变成非魔法棒。亡灵杖和三脚架的 AC 值为 19，命中点数为 5，对毒药和精神伤害免疫。",

The tyrant keeps the strict letter of any promise it makes, but as it cares nothing for living creatures and respects only power, characters who try to direct it against Mekkalath might regret their decision. For example, the death tyrant might agree to attack the dragon, then start by slaying the peaceful minotaurs and turning them into its zombie minions. Mekkalath is aware of the death tyrant, and if it escapes, Mekkalath soon moves to destroy this potential rival and secure his dominance over the hill.

	"The summit of the hill was once crowded with buildings. All but a few were destroyed in the siege of the abbey centuries ago, and the remainder were badly damaged. Mekkalath's arrival caused additional destruction: the red dragon's magic triggered volcanic activity that left the area riddled with flaming pits, rocky outcroppings, and rivers of lava. His magic also opened portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, bringing salamanders and fire elementals to the hilltop. The dragon's domain, shown in map 16.2, is the most dangerous part of the ruins by far.": "山顶曾是建筑密集之地。几个世纪前，修道院被围攻，除少数建筑被毁外，其余建筑均遭到严重破坏。梅卡拉斯的到来造成了更多的破坏：红龙的魔法引发了火山活动，使这里到处都是火焰坑、岩石露头和熔岩河。他的魔法还打开了通往火元素界的门户，将蝾螈和火元素带到了山顶。巨龙的领地如地图 16.2 所示，是废墟中最危险的地方。",
