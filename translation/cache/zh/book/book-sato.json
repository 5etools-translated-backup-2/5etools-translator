Those who seek the wonders of the planes take their first step into the endless possibilities of a Planescape campaign.": "多元宇宙是已知的一切，也是未知的一切。多元宇宙囊括了世界、星球、生命和死亡，它的无穷无尽充满了惊奇、恐怖、秘密以及最重要的可能性。每一次 D&D 冒险都发生在多元宇宙中。在物质界的孤独世界之外，还有数不清的其他现实，以及连接永恒每一个边缘的路径和门户。那些想要探寻星界奥妙的人，将在 Planescape 活动的无尽可能性中迈出第一步。",

Adventures in Planescape campaigns often focus on the following themes:": "Planescape 是 D&D 多元宇宙，还有更多。除了 (%0%)（详见 (%1%)）之外，《Planescape》还专注于打破现实的冒险和美学，与凡人世界的冒险和美学完全不同。就像其他 D&D 场景突出某些概念，但可以承载任何类型的冒险或游戏风格一样，《星际争霸》也是如此。Planescape 活动中的冒险通常侧重于以下主题：",
	"Planescape adventures provide glimpses of the daily lives of unfathomable beings—like gods, angels, and demons—and how they act (and interact) when mortals aren't their primary concern. The mysteries of life and the afterlife are widely known to these creatures.": "Planescape 冒险让我们一窥深不可测的生物--如神、天使和恶魔--的日常生活，以及当凡人不再是他们的主要关注对象时，他们是如何行动（和互动）的。这些生物对生命和来世的奥秘了如指掌。",

Adventurers are likely to see multiple impossible sights every day.": "Planescape 冒险跨越世界、位面和可能性。在不可思议的领域之间旅行很常见，尤其是通过西格尔（Sigil）和外域（Outlands）等传送门丰富的地方（详见本书）。冒险者每天都有可能看到多个不可能看到的景象。",

	"The multiverse makes room for everything, and beliefs manifest as fantastic creatures. Planescape adventures often pit philosophies against one another and highlight subjective views. Situations might encourage characters to reexamine their beliefs in the face of plane-spanning philosophies, conflicts, and revelations.": "多元宇宙容纳万物，而信仰则表现为奇妙的生物。星球探险通常会让各种哲学相互对立，并突出主观观点。面对跨越星球的哲学、冲突和启示，一些情况可能会鼓励角色重新审视自己的信念。",

Although adventurers might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of the multiverse, their choices hold the power to change reality.": "这些星球是拥有惊人力量的生物的家园，然而最微小的事情也会产生影响。虽然冒险者在多元宇宙的宏大计划中可能显得微不足道，但他们的选择却拥有改变现实的力量。",

	"Sigil is the crossroads of the multiverse, a city at the center of the Great Wheel. Connected to every plane of existence and the infinite worlds among them, the City of Doors brims with commerce, travel, schemes, and adventure. Sigil is commonly referred to as the Cage because the only way into or out of the city is through one of its countless portals—pathways controlled by the enigmatic Lady of Pain.": "西格尔是多元宇宙的十字路口，是大转轮中心的一座城市。门之城连接着每一个存在的位面和其中的无限世界，这里充满了商业、旅行、阴谋和冒险。西格尔通常被称为 \"牢笼\"，因为进出这座城市的唯一途径就是通过由神秘的痛苦女士控制的无数传送门之一。",
	"Sigil simultaneously exists at the center of the Great Wheel and nowhere. In the middle of the Outlands, an impossibly tall needle of a mountain, the Spire, rises into the sky. Sigil floats above the apex of the Spire, barely visible from the ground, constructed on the inside of a massive stone torus. Attempts to ascend to the city by climbing or flight are futile, as are efforts to reach the top of the Spire.": "西格尔（Sigil）同时位于巨轮的中心，却又无处不在。在外域的中央，一座高不可攀的山峰--尖塔--直插云霄。西格尔城漂浮在尖塔的顶点之上，从地面上几乎看不到，它建造在一个巨大的石环内部。试图通过攀爬或飞行到达城市都是徒劳的，到达尖塔顶端的努力也是徒劳的。",
	"Once inside the city, a visitor is greeted by a vast urban tangle of bladed buildings in a wild array of architectural styles. Built within a great ring, the city curves before and behind observers, as if they stood in a bowl or valley, stretching upward and disappearing into an industrial haze. On a clear day, a creature that looks upward sees the other side of the city, curving far overhead. Visitors can find this reality unsettling. There are no suns, moons, stars, or other celestial bodies in the sky above Sigil, though city lights twinkle above in the darkest hours.": "一进入城市，映入眼帘的是由各种建筑风格的鳞次栉比的建筑物组成的巨大城市建筑群。城市建在一个巨大的环形中，在观察者的前后左右弯曲，就像站在一个碗或山谷中，向上延伸，消失在一片工业雾霾中。在天气晴朗的日子里，抬头仰望，可以看到城市的另一面，远远地弯曲在头顶上。游客可能会对这种现实感到不安。西吉尔的上空没有太阳、月亮、星星或其他天体，尽管城市的灯光在最黑暗的时刻闪烁。",
	"Sigil is built to the edges of the ring, forming a wall of structures along its border. Anyone who climbs atop this outer wall of buildings can look out over the edge into an empty sky. Few who cross the edge are ever heard from again. Those who pass over the edge don't end up in the Outlands; rather, they are flung to random corners of the planes.": "西格尔城建在环形山的边缘，沿着环形山的边界形成了一堵建筑墙。任何爬上这堵建筑外墙的人，都能从边缘看到空旷的天空。越过边缘的人很少再有消息。那些越过边缘的人最终并没有到达外域；相反，他们被随意地扔到了星球的各个角落。",

	"Sigil has the following features:": "Sigil 具有以下功能：",
	"Sigil observes a 24-hour day-night cycle. The sky gradually fills with luminescence during the day and fades into deep darkness at night. This light isn't sunlight. Sigil's brightest and darkest points in time are known as peak and antipeak.": "西格尔实行 24 小时昼夜循环。白天，天空逐渐充满荧光，到了夜晚，天空逐渐暗淡下来。这种光并不是阳光。西格尔最亮和最暗的时间点被称为峰值和反峰值。",
	"Objects are pulled toward whichever section of the city's ground is closest.": "物体会被拉向离城市地面最近的区域。",

	"Extradimensional spaces, demiplanes, and pocket dimensions—such as those created by a (%0%) or the (%1%) spell—function within Sigil, but those spaces follow all these restrictions as if they were part of the city.": "超次元空间、半位面和袖珍空间--例如由 (%0%) 或 (%1%) 法术创建的空间--在西格尔城内运行，但这些空间遵循所有这些限制，就好像它们是城市的一部分。",
	"Effects that allow interplanar travel, such as (%0%) or (%1%), fail if used to try to enter or leave Sigil, with one exception (see the \"Teleportation Circles\" section below).": "允许星际旅行的效果，如 (%0%) 或 (%1%)，如果用来试图进入或离开西格尔，则会失败，但有一个例外（见下文 \"传送圈 \"部分）。",

Effects that summon a specific target from outside Sigil, as with a (%1%) spell, fail automatically.": "从其他位面召唤生物或物体的法术、魔法物品和效果，例如 (%0%)，如果可能的话，会从西格尔城内召唤目标，否则就会失败。从西格尔之外召唤特定目标的效果，如 (%1%) 法术，会自动失效。",

	"Summoning in the Cage": "笼中召唤",
	"With the exception of permanent teleportation circles, the Lady of Pain prevents spells and other powers from allowing anything to enter the City of Doors. That means creatures and objects from outside in the multiverse can't be summoned or conjured into Sigil by any means. Summoning abilities a character might have, such as the (%0%) spell or a class feature that summons a companion, still function as normal with these features calling only creatures that exist somewhere within Sigil itself.": "除了永久传送圈之外，痛苦女士会阻止咒语和其他力量进入门之城。这意味着无法通过任何方式召唤或变幻来自外部多元宇宙的生物和物体进入西格尔城。角色可能拥有的召唤能力，如 (%0%) 法术或召唤同伴的类别功能，仍可正常使用，这些功能只能召唤西格尔城内的生物。",
	"The unique planar geography of Sigil should create interesting, even if sometimes confounding, twists, but it shouldn't prevent a character from doing what they do best.": "西格尔独特的平面地理应该会产生有趣的、有时甚至是令人困惑的转折，但它不应该妨碍角色做他们最擅长的事情。",
	"Creatures from every corner of the planes live and toil in the City of Doors, bringing fragments of their cultures to the multiversal hub. Over eons, these cultural tenets have blended and evolved into a unique way of life made possible by the myriad portals that exist at the Lady of Pain's sufferance.": "来自各个位面的生物在门之城中生活和劳作，将他们的文化碎片带到了这个多元世界的中心。经过漫长的岁月，这些文化信条已经融合并演变成了一种独特的生活方式，而痛苦之女所容忍的无数传送门则让这种生活方式成为可能。",
	"Sigil is the backstage of the multiverse. Celestials and Fiends share drinks in genie-owned taverns, agents of evil gods trot through the streets astride (%0%), and hags stable faerie steeds alongside (%1%) and beasts of living stone. As a result of this mingling, fundamentally incompatible parts of the multiverse come into direct contact. They don't always clash, but when they do, authorities maintain order and stifle cosmic peril. Only when these eruptions threaten the city on a grand scale does the Lady of Pain intervene.": "西格尔是多元宇宙的后台。天人和煞神在精灵开的酒馆里共享美酒，邪神的代理人骑着 (%0%) 小跑着穿过街道，巫妖在 (%1%) 和活石野兽身边牵着精灵骏马。由于这种交融，多元宇宙中根本不相容的部分开始直接接触。它们并不总是发生冲突，但一旦发生冲突，当局就会维持秩序，扼杀宇宙危险。只有当这些爆发对城市造成大规模威胁时，痛苦女士才会出手干预。",
	"Humans are the earliest known inhabitants of the City of Doors. Some sages track the existence and spread of humans back to Sigil itself, rather than to a deity or its creations.": "人类是门之城已知最早的居民。一些贤者将人类的存在和传播追溯到西格尔本身，而非神灵或其创造物。",
	"Various factions handle the day-to-day governance of Sigil, enforcement of laws, and maintenance of civic infrastructure. These groups each follow a philosophy inspired by a cosmic aspect of the multiverse, and they actively recruit visitors and citizens into their ranks.": "各种派别负责西格尔的日常管理、法律执行和市政基础设施维护。这些团体各自遵循一种哲学，其灵感来自多元宇宙的某个方面，他们积极招募游客和市民加入他们的队伍。",
	"Gods and godlike figures—including archdevils and demon lords—can't enter Sigil by any means. However, their schemes and influence still find their way into the city through their agents.": "神明和神一样的人物，包括大恶魔和恶魔领主，无论如何都无法进入西格尔城。然而，他们的阴谋和影响力仍会通过他们的代理人进入这座城市。",
	"Neither port nor proximity dictates trade in the City of Doors, granting its merchants and artisans access to the planes and their wondrous offerings. Woodcarvers whittle toys from golden trees toppled in Arborea, blacksmiths forge weapons from infernal ingots, and tavern chefs cook halfling recipes passed down on worlds of the Material Plane. With enough time, connections, and coin, one can find anything in Sigil's markets.": "门之城的贸易不受港口或距离的限制，这里的商人和工匠可以接触到各个位面及其奇妙的产品。木雕匠用阿波瑞亚（Arborea）倒塌的金色树木打磨玩具，铁匠用地狱之锭锻造武器，酒馆厨师则烹饪流传于物质位面的半身人食谱。只要有足够的时间、关系和金钱，人们就能在西格尔的市场上找到任何东西。",
	"A dizzying array of coinage flows through Sigil. It doesn't matter where a coin was minted—if it's made of precious metal and the weight is right, the money is usually good. However, some traders are particular about the currencies they accept. An (%0%) merchant selling instruments from the City of Brass might accept only rainbow sapphires from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Perhaps a (%1%) hawking rare spell components refuses all currency but fresh (%2%) from Hades, while a (%3%) might siphon years off the buyer's life as payment for a diabolical blade.": "令人眼花缭乱的钱币在西格尔流淌。硬币在哪里铸造并不重要，只要是贵金属制成，重量合适，通常都是好钱。不过，有些商人对他们接受的货币很挑剔。一个 (%0%) 从黄铜城出售乐器的商人可能只接受来自土元素界的彩虹蓝宝石。也许一个出售稀有法术组件的 (%1%) 商人拒绝接受任何货币，只接受来自冥府的新鲜 (%2%)，而一个 (%3%) 商人可能会抽走买主数年的寿命，作为一把邪恶之刃的报酬。",
	"Buyers can find goods of every shape, size, and sort in one of Sigil's many marketplaces, the largest of which is the Great Bazaar (see the \"(%0%)\" section later in this chapter), though individual businesses lie scattered among the wards.": "买家可以在西格尔的众多集市中找到各种形状、大小和种类的商品，其中最大的集市是大集市（见本章后面的\"(%0%) \"部分），不过个体商户也散布在各区。",
	"Any and every service is for sale in the Cage. Courier services staffed by mephits, imps, and (%0%) (see (%1%)) carry messages across planar boundaries. Brave exterminators rid buildings of cranium rats, curses, and dangerous afflictions. Clandestine agencies offer escape from infernal debt collectors or other looming perils by killing their clients, keeping the bodies safe and preserved, and resurrecting them when trouble has died down, sometimes years or decades later.": "笼子里出售各种服务。由 mephits、imp 和 (%0%) （见 (%1%)）组成的信使服务可以跨越平面边界传递信息。勇敢的灭虫者为建筑物除去颅鼠、诅咒和危险的折磨。秘密机构通过杀死客户、安全保存尸体，并在麻烦平息后（有时是几年或几十年后）复活客户，从而帮助他们逃离无间讨债人或其他迫在眉睫的危险。",
	"Travelers from across the multiverse flood the city, whose establishments cater to a diverse clientele. Taverns and inns are common, their taprooms shaped by the fantastical folk who own them—angels, githzerai, and a host of friendly monsters who scrape by in the City of Doors. No matter where a visitor is from, they can find familiar comforts in Sigil.": "来自多元宇宙的旅行者涌入这座城市，这里的设施满足了不同顾客的需求。酒馆和旅店很常见，它们的小酒馆是由拥有这些酒馆的奇幻居民--天使、吉斯泽莱和许多在门之城勉强度日的友好怪物--打造的。无论游客来自哪里，都能在西格尔找到熟悉的舒适感。",
	"Knowing where to look for something one needs is made challenging by Sigil's prodigious sprawl. Without the aid of magic or in-depth knowledge of portals within the city and their destinations, navigating the Cage is a dizzying affair.": "由于西格尔城幅员辽阔，要知道去哪里找自己需要的东西非常困难。如果没有魔法的帮助，也不深入了解城内的传送门及其目的地，在囚笼中穿梭是一件令人头晕目眩的事情。",
	"Fortunately, two services exist throughout Sigil to help travelers find their way: sedan chairs and touts. Visitors to the Clerks' Ward can also hire the cabs of (%0%) (see the \"(%1%)\" section).": "幸运的是，在整个西格尔（Sigil）有两种服务可以帮助旅行者找到方向：轿子和兜售者。文员区的游客还可以租用 (%0%) 的出租车（参见\"(%1%) \"部分）。",
	"Sedan chairs are comfortable chairs carried by burly types, Humanoid or otherwise. Sedan chairs act as a citywide taxi service, lingering near civic buildings, municipal hubs, and marketplaces.": "轿车椅是一种舒适的椅子，由魁梧的人形或其他类型的人抬着。轿车椅充当着全城出租车服务的角色，在市政建筑、市政枢纽和集市附近徘徊。",
	"A typical sedan chair ride costs 1 sp per passenger and can carry two Medium or smaller creatures to a destination in Sigil, but there are some places they simply won't go—like (%0%) or unsafe parts of the (%1%). Heavier chairs that ferry larger customers or groups exist, carried by brawny creatures such as (%2%) or (%3%). These deluxe chairs cost more, a minimum of 1 gp per passenger, and those who carry them might be willing to travel to dangerous areas of the city for an extra fee.": "典型的轿子每名乘客花费 1 斯普，可以载两个中型或更小的生物到西格尔的目的地，但有些地方它们根本就去不了，比如（%0%）或（%1%）不安全的地方。还有更重的椅子可以运送更多的顾客或团体，由（%2%）或（%3%）等强壮的生物抬着。这些豪华椅子的价格较高，每名乘客至少需要 1 古普，而携带这些椅子的人可能愿意为额外的费用前往城市的危险地区。",
	"Touts are independent local guides and translators who know the ins and outs of Sigil's wards. The best touts know shortcuts through the city to hidden gems off the beaten paths.": "兜客是当地独立的向导和翻译，他们了解西格尔区的方方面面。最好的兜售者知道如何抄近路穿过城市，找到不为人知的宝藏。",
	"A typical tout charges 2 sp per hour of guidance. More reliable touts vetted by influential clients charge premium prices, starting at 2 gp per hour. Touts who speak more esoteric languages, who have connections with one or more factions, or who can provide magical assistance can command upward of 20 gp per hour.": "一般的兜售者每小时收取 2 sp 的指导费用。经有影响力的客户审查过的更可靠的兜售者会收取更高的价格，起价为每小时 2 古普。会说更深奥语言、与一个或多个派别有联系、或能提供魔法帮助的兜售者，每小时的价格可高达 20 古普。",
	"As people and beings from everywhere find their way to Sigil, every conceivable language comes with them. Common is the most frequently spoken language. The fact that Common-speaking travelers from different worlds can meet in Sigil and understand one another perplexes linguists and suggests that the language originated in Sigil. Creatures native to Sigil are typically fluent in Common and one other language.": "当来自四面八方的人们和生物来到西格尔时，所有能想到的语言都随之而来。通用语是最常用的语言。来自不同世界说通用语的旅行者能在西格尔相遇并相互理解，这让语言学家们感到困惑，同时也表明通用语起源于西格尔。西格尔的本地生物通常精通通用语和一种其他语言。",
	"Visitors who need help communicating can always find touts willing to translate for a price. This service extends to the Cant, a complex local slang heard in some corners of the city.": "游客如果在交流上需要帮助，总能找到愿意付费翻译的小贩。这种服务还延伸到坎特语（Cant），这是一种在城市的某些角落听到的复杂的当地俚语。",

Outside of private gardens and the occasional community plot, the only plant that flourishes in the City of Doors is razorvine, a prickly hazard native to the Lower Planes.

	"Most portals aren't always open. Instead, they open at certain times, when a particular condition is met, in response to a command word or phrase, or when a traveler is holding a particular object called a portal key. When a creature with a portal's key crosses a portal's threshold, the portal remains open until the start of that creature's next turn.": "大多数传送门并不总是打开的。相反，它们会在特定的时间、特定的条件满足时、响应指令词或短语时，或者当旅行者持有一种叫做传送门钥匙的特定物品时开启。当持有传送门钥匙的生物跨过传送门的门槛时，传送门会一直打开，直到该生物的下一个回合开始。",
	"Portals are usually invisible when they're inactive (including to (%0%) spells), but they can be detected by the (%1%) or (%2%) spell (see (%3%) of this book for a description of the latter).

	"Far rarer are portal keys that aren't objects. These can be simple or strange: a type of creature, a memory in the traveler's mind, or a whistled tune.": "非物体的传送门钥匙则更为罕见。这些钥匙可以是简单的，也可以是奇特的：一种生物、旅行者脑海中的一段记忆，或者一首口哨小调。",
	"Some portals have strange magical quirks. If you want to dress up a standard portal, roll on the Portal Quirks table or choose from its examples.": "有些传送门有奇特的魔法怪癖。如果你想给一个标准传送门换装，可以在传送门怪癖表中进行掷骰，或者从表中的示例中进行选择。",
	"One-Way. The portal functions only one way, either into or out of Sigil. The portal isn't visible or detectable from the exit side.": "单向。传送门只有一个功能，即进入或离开西格尔。从出口一侧无法看到或探测到传送门。",
	"Shifting. One end of the portal moves in a pattern between different locations in Sigil or the destination plane.": "移动。传送门的一端在西格尔或目的地平面的不同位置之间以某种模式移动。",

	"The greatest entity in Sigil is the Lady of Pain, an eternal being who watches over the Cage. She appears almost human, although she most definitely isn't. She wears ornate robes that shroud her body, and a mantle of blades coated in blue-green verdigris surrounds her masklike face. No one is certain who or what exactly the Lady of Pain is, but it's widely accepted she's a being on par with deities. Strong enough to bar gods and their ilk from entering her city, the Lady of Pain forbids followers of her own. To worship her is more than taboo; it is an unforgivable crime punishable by imprisonment in the Mazes.": "西格尔最伟大的实体是痛苦女士，她是看守囚笼的永恒存在。她看起来几乎是人类，但她绝对不是人类。她穿着华丽的长袍，长袍包裹着她的身体，蓝绿色的翠绿色刀片围绕着她面具般的脸庞。没有人确定痛苦之女到底是谁，也没有人知道她到底是什么，但人们普遍认为她是与神灵同等的存在。痛苦女士强大到足以禁止神灵和他们的同类进入她的城市，她也禁止自己的追随者进入她的城市。崇拜她不仅仅是禁忌，更是不可饶恕的罪行，会被关进迷宫。",
	"The Lady maintains the cosmic neutrality of Sigil. The city doesn't take part in the Blood War, it doesn't throw its weight behind the shining righteousness of Mount Celestia or contracts originating in the Nine Hells, and it's never a battleground for the conflicts of Material Plane worlds.": "女士保持着西格尔的宇宙中立。这座城市不参与血战，不支持天体山的正义之光或源自九幽地狱的契约，也从来不是物质位面世界冲突的战场。",
	"On rare occasions, the Lady of Pain drifts through the streets, hovering above the ground. Creatures that interfere with her are flayed by her stare or vanish into nothingness as she turns to face them. Wise travelers give the Lady a wide berth, finding pressing business elsewhere as she passes by. Some locals claim that the Lady's features occasionally take on a golden or steely sheen. Whether this is in response to threats to her city or other influences is a mystery.": "在极少数情况下，痛苦女士会在街道上飘荡，在地面上盘旋。当她转过身来时，妨碍她的生物会被她的凝视剥皮，或化为虚无。聪明的旅行者会远远地避开痛苦女士，等她经过时再去找其他要紧的事。一些当地人声称，这位女士的五官偶尔会呈现出金色或坚毅的光泽。这究竟是为了应对她的城市所面临的威胁，还是受到其他影响，目前还是个谜。",
	"Residents of Sigil view the Lady of Pain with fearful awe. A distant guardian, she leaves the city's daily governance to the many factions that call it home. She has no residence, and no temples to her exist within the city.": "西格尔的居民对痛苦之女充满敬畏。作为一个遥远的守护者，她将城市的日常管理交给了许多以其为家的派系。她没有居所，城中也没有供奉她的神庙。",
	"The Lady's means of protecting Sigil are the dabus, the Mazes, and her complete control over the city's portals.": "女士保护西格尔的手段是达布斯、迷宫和她对城市入口的完全控制。",
	"Dabus are silent, floating beings who serve the Lady of Pain. Found only in Sigil, dabus communicate through visual rebuses, conjured illusory images that convey their thoughts.": "达布斯是无声的漂浮生物，为痛苦女士服务。达布斯只在西格尔（Sigil）才有，他们通过视觉反弹进行交流，这些反弹是幻化出来的虚幻图像，能传达他们的思想。",
	"Dabus maintain Sigil's infrastructure, repairing crumbling buildings, ensuring portals function properly, cutting back rampant razorvine, and patching city streets. To most citizens of Sigil, dabus are nothing more than cryptic workers, yet these mysterious beings also punish those who disrupt city life. Whatever opposes the Lady's edicts or the smooth functioning of Sigil, dabus work to correct.": "达布斯负责维护西格尔的基础设施，修理摇摇欲坠的建筑，确保传送门正常运行，砍伐肆虐的剃刀藤，修补城市街道。对大多数西格尔市民来说，达布斯不过是个神秘的工人，但这些神秘的生物也会惩罚那些破坏城市生活的人。不管是反对女士的法令还是反对西格尔的顺利运转，达布斯都会努力纠正。",

	"The Mazes are demiplanar cages created by the Lady of Pain. Reserved for would-be power mongers and dissidents who threaten the city on a grand scale—or foolishly target the Lady herself—the Mazes swallow their prisoners in an instant. The Mazes resemble a dense labyrinth of empty streets and alleys in Sigil but are devoid of life and repeat endlessly.": "迷宫是痛苦女士制造的半平面牢笼。迷宫是专为那些威胁城市安全或愚蠢地以痛苦女士本人为目标的潜在强权者和持异议者准备的，迷宫会在瞬间吞没他们的囚犯。迷宫就像西格尔城中空无一人的街道和小巷组成的密集迷宫，但却没有生命，而且会无休止地重复。",
	"No magic allows a creature banished to the Mazes to escape or communicate with the planes beyond. Creatures in the Mazes don't require food, drink, or sleep and are cursed to an indefinite, isolated existence. An urban legend states the Lady of Pain leaves a single portal in every Maze, but finding the escape route is all but impossible for the imprisoned, as even if such portals exist, they can't be detected through magical means. The few who claim to have escaped the Mazes are quickly branded as liars.": "被放逐到迷宫中的生物无法使用任何魔法逃离迷宫，也无法与迷宫外的世界交流。迷宫中的生物不需要吃喝拉撒，被诅咒无限期地与世隔绝。一个都市传说称，痛苦女士会在每个迷宫中留下一个传送门，但对于被囚禁的人来说，找到逃生路线几乎是不可能的，因为即使存在这样的传送门，也无法通过魔法手段探测到。少数声称逃出迷宫的人很快就被打上了骗子的烙印。",
	"Sigil's portals operate at the Lady of Pain's will, as do the few permanent teleportation circles hidden among the city's wards. Her influence stops spells and other features from allowing creatures to enter or leave the city. She even bars gods from stepping foot in the city—a ban she can extend to anyone at any time. The Lady knows when any creature uses a portal and can block that creature from entering or leaving, but she reserves this intervention for extreme circumstances.": "西格尔的传送门是按照痛苦女士的意志运行的，隐藏在城市护栏中的几个永久性传送圈也是如此。在她的影响下，咒语和其他功能都无法让生物进入或离开这座城市。她甚至禁止神灵踏入这座城市--她可以在任何时候将禁令扩展至任何人。当任何生物使用传送门时，女士都会知道，并且可以阻止该生物进出，但她只在极端情况下才采取这种干预措施。",
	"During times of great strife, notably when Sigil's factions war openly against one another, the Lady can cause all the city's portals to cease functioning. This grinds the city to a halt; food and drink can't enter the city, sewage and refuse pool in the streets, and corpses stack in the Mortuary with no hope of being interred. This compels the factions to quickly resolve their conflicts.": "在大纷争时期，尤其是西格尔各派别之间公开交战时，圣母会导致城市的所有传送门停止运作。这将使城市陷入停顿；食物和饮料无法进入城市，街道上污水横流，垃圾遍地，尸体堆放在停尸房，无法安葬。这迫使各派迅速解决他们之间的冲突。",
	"The Lady of Pain is omnipresent, unknowable, and invincible. With a look, she can flense troublesome creatures to within an inch of their lives. Any creature that targets her with an attack, a spell, or any other hostile or prying effect—in some cases so much as speaking to her—is assailed by overwhelming pain and immediately drops to 1 hit point. If the creature hasn't learned its lesson, the Lady sends it to the Mazes in the next blink.": "痛苦之女无所不在、无人知晓、所向披靡。只需一个眼神，她就能将麻烦的生物烧得魂飞魄散。任何以她为攻击目标的生物、咒语或任何其他敌对或窥探效果--有时甚至是对她说话--都会受到压倒性的疼痛侵袭，并立即降至 1 点命中率。如果生物还没有吸取教训，女士就会在下一秒将其送入迷宫。",
	"Similar to other godlike beings, the Lady of Pain has no stat block. She is beyond the ability of characters to defeat by conventional means.": "与其他神灵类似，痛苦女士也没有任何属性限制。角色无法通过常规手段击败她。",
	"On the Outer Planes, belief shapes reality. Cosmic concepts such as law and chaos can imbue true believers with newfound power, and when enough creatures unite under one ideology, their beliefs can remold the planes themselves. In Sigil, this power rests with the factions, like-minded philosophers guided by cosmic truths about the multiverse and its workings. Their philosophies are often associated with a plane or realm.": "在外层位面，信仰塑造现实。当足够多的生物团结在一种意识形态之下时，他们的信仰就能重塑位面本身。在西格尔，这种力量由各派系掌握，他们是志同道合的哲学家，以多元宇宙及其运作的宇宙真理为指导。他们的哲学通常与某个位面或领域相关联。",
	"Factions control aspects of civic existence in Sigil, governing the day-to-day needs of a thriving metropolis, such as entertainment or law enforcement. Despite their influence within the city, factions have been erased from the city in the past, and current factions tread carefully to avoid that fate for themselves. They actively recruit new members from citizenry, travelers, and even the ranks of other factions. In the meantime, they vie for power in the Cage in a way that doesn't upset Sigil's order or provoke the Lady of Pain.": "派系控制着西格尔市民生活的方方面面，管理着一个繁荣大都市的日常需求，如娱乐或执法。尽管派系在城市中具有影响力，但它们在过去也曾被从城市中抹去，而现在的派系则小心翼翼地避免自己遭到这种命运。他们积极从市民、旅行者甚至其他派别中招募新成员。与此同时，他们以一种不会扰乱西格尔秩序或激怒痛苦女士的方式争夺牢笼中的权力。",

Factols and their delegates also represent their factions in a council that debates and passes laws in the (%0%) (see the \"(%1%)\" section later in this chapter). Most factions also have a physical headquarters in Sigil where they carry out aspects of civic governance. Within these areas, both geographical and influential, dedicated midranking faction members called factotums act as officers, furthering the interests of their factions within the city as clerks, squad leaders, and tutors. Factotums also keep an eye out for promising recruits to their philosophy.": "派系由被称为派系领袖的个人领导。这些领导者体现了各自团体的理念，并根据派别的需要扮演不同的角色。派系领袖和他们的代表也在议会中代表他们的派系，在 (%0%) 中辩论并通过法律（请参阅本章后面的\"(%1%) \"部分）。大多数派系在西格尔都有一个实际的总部，他们在那里进行公民管理。在这些地区，无论是地理位置还是影响力，被称为 \"派系导师\"（factotums）的专职中级派系成员都会充当官员，以书记员、小队长和导师的身份在城市中促进本派系的利益。派系领袖们还会注意招募有前途的新成员加入他们的理念。",
	"Factions wax and wane, shifting the balance of power in Sigil. The most influential factions are known as ascendant factions, widely recognized groups that oversee aspects of daily life in the city. Currently Sigil has twelve ascendant factions.": "派系此消彼长，改变着西格尔城的权力平衡。最有影响力的派系被称为长老派，它们是公认的团体，负责监督城市日常生活的方方面面。目前，西格尔有十二个长老派系。",
	"The following sections present these factions, along with notes on their leaders, sites in Sigil that serve as their headquarters (detailed later in this chapter), planes on which they operate, common members, common nicknames, and their roles in the City of Doors.": "以下各节将介绍这些派系，并说明其领导人、作为其总部的西格尔遗址（本章稍后将详细介绍）、他们赖以生存的星球、共同成员、共同绰号以及他们在门之城的作用。",

	"Defiers accept that there might be true deities that oversee everything, but such beings are beyond comprehension. They assert that worshipers of the gods draw their power from unknowable sources—false gods simply take the credit.": "捍卫者承认可能有真正的神灵掌管着一切，但这种存在是无法理解的。他们断言，神灵崇拜者的力量来自不可知的来源--假神只是攫取了功劳。",

While many Defiers become bitter, Terrance remains compassionate, pointing wayward souls toward truth like a friendly guide—a guardian and shepherd of priests who fall from their previous devotions.

Existence is merciless, so the Bleak Cabal must show mercy in its stead.": "对 \"黑暗组织 \"来说，追求宇宙的意义是徒劳的--多元宇宙没有意义，也不应该有意义。由于没有更伟大的真理，个人必须从多元宇宙中获得自己的意义。这种反思激发了许多布莱克人的同情心和善良，他们致力于减轻他人的痛苦。生存是无情的，因此凄凉者组织必须以仁慈来代替它。",

	"In addition to the ascendant factions, Sigil contains a host of minor factions—up-and-coming philosophies, those that have seen a resurgence of members, and once-ascendant factions whose ideologies have since entered a period of decline. The following are three examples of minor factions currently in Sigil.": "除了崛起的派系，西格尔还有许多小派系，它们有的是新崛起的派系，有的是重新崛起的派系，还有一些曾经崛起的派系，但它们的意识形态已进入衰退期。以下是西格尔目前存在的三个小派系的例子。",

Most thought the tower was banished to the Mazes, but it has since returned, rematerializing in the vacant lot where it once stood, bringing with it the return of the Incantifers. Members of the Incanterium siphon magic from items, spells, and those who wield them to lengthen their own lifespans. They believe that by absorbing magic and mastering its rules, one can rewrite reality.": "当它的总部--位于（%0%）的巫术塔--与所有已知的 \"焚化者 \"一起消失时，\"焚化者 \"曾被认为是一个消亡的派系。大多数人认为这座塔被放逐到了迷宫，但它后来又回来了，在它曾经矗立的空地上重新显形，并带来了 \"咒师 \"的回归。咒师团的成员从物品、咒语和使用它们的人身上吸取魔力，以延长自己的寿命。他们相信，只要吸收魔法并掌握其规则，就能改写现实。",

	"A direct foil to the selfish Fated, the Ring Givers hold a philosophy of charity and giving as the path to enlightenment. The Bargainers give away all they have and redistribute the hoards of greedy tycoons to the poor and needy. A common superstition in Sigil holds that any gift to the Ring Givers comes back to the donor tenfold.": "作为自私自利的 \"命中注定 \"的直接对立面，赠戒者奉行慈善和施舍的理念，并将其视为通往觉悟之路。讨价还价者将他们所拥有的一切拱手相让，并将贪婪大亨的财富重新分配给穷人和需要帮助的人。西格尔有一个普遍的迷信说法，认为赠与赠戒者的任何礼物都会十倍奉还给赠与者。",
	"The City of Doors is divided into wards that are as varied as their inhabitants, from the polished heights of the bureaucratic (%0%) to the musty anarchy of (%1%), the city's forsaken warrens. Each ward contains one or more faction headquarters: grand buildings where Sigil's philosophers convene and divide the city's functions.

	"Despite its rigidity, the Clerks' Ward is a place of beauty and wonder, due in large part to the presence of the Society of Sensation. For each strict fact-checker, policy maker, and enforcer in the ward, there is an open-minded artisan, entertainer, or thrill-seeker to match. Locals routinely direct inquisitive newcomers to the Hall of Information, where visitors can ask questions, hail a sedan chair, or pester a tout for directions.": "尽管拘谨，书记员病房仍是一个充满美丽和奇迹的地方，这在很大程度上要归功于 \"感官协会 \"的存在。区里每一位严格的事实核查者、政策制定者和执行者，都有一位思想开放的工匠、娱乐家或刺激爱好者与之相匹配。当地人通常会把好奇的新来者带到信息大厅，游客可以在这里提问、叫轿或向兜售者问路。",

The Fated regularly hires adventurers as debt collectors.": "命运之子是西格尔的收税人，他们利用自己的行政地位来满足贪得无厌的欲望，因此广受人们的唾弃。收税人将财务协议记录在记录大厅中，并在业主拖欠付款时以低廉的价格没收财产。命定者经常雇佣冒险者作为收债人。",
	"Long thought to have been banished to the Mazes by the Lady of Pain along with their base of operations, members of the Incanterium are slowly trickling back into the Cage. Called \"mage drinkers\" by the few who remember them, the aged Incantifers siphon magic to sustain their ancient power.

	"The Civic Festhall boasts a panoply of arts available to the public. Galleries, concert and lecture halls, museums, and exhibits too eccentric to describe fill the festhall and its satellite buildings. Contests and duels are held at the Northumber, an outdoor amphitheater, while magical light checkers the stages of its two indoor theaters: the intimate Elloweth Theater and the prodigious Ren Hall. Elloweth Theater is renowned as Sigil's preeminent venue for high-brow performance art, and performers from across the Great Wheel flock to Elloweth Theater to take their shot at interplanar fame.

	"The most popular offerings in the Civic Festhall are the Sensoriums, semiprivate rooms where creatures can record and relive one another's sensory experiences through (%0%) (see (%1%) of this book). For a price of 10 gp, a client can feel the thrill of a researcher's epiphany, the weight of a widow's grief, or the warm bite of a flaky pastry.

	"The Society of Sensation pays well for sensations not contained in its extensive collection. Sensates reward adventurers for delivering (%0%) that contain coveted yet dangerous experiences, such as the thrill of stealing a coin from a sleeping dragon's hoard.

	"Once a thriving college, the Hall of Records was foreclosed on for a slightly overdue debt to the Fated centuries ago. The Fated has since repurposed the building as its headquarters. The campus consists of six stately towers—originally seven, but the library was sold and walled off—and a sprawling network of underground archives linked to each of the academy's founding structures.": "记录大厅曾经是一所繁荣的学院，几个世纪前因为欠了命中注定的人一笔略微逾期的债务而被取消了赎回权。此后，命运之神将这座建筑重新用作其总部。校园由六座庄严的塔楼（原本有七座，但图书馆被卖掉并被围墙隔开）和一个庞大的地下档案馆网络组成，与学院的每座创始建筑相连。",

Clerks file property deeds, issue birth and death certificates, and maintain extensive financial records, while scriveners meticulously prepare official proclamations for posting.": "在守卫森严的建筑群内，\"命中注定 \"成员负责处理各种文件。文员负责归档财产契约、签发出生和死亡证明、保存大量财务记录，而抄写员则一丝不苟地准备官方公告，以便张贴。",
	"In theory, anyone in Sigil with proper approval can request a specific document or wade through the hall's dusty stacks, but the process is mired in bureaucratic entanglements. More often, a bribe can accomplish as much in half the time, and hefty sums can convince a Taker to lose or even alter a document in the Hall of Records.": "理论上，西格尔的任何人只要获得适当的批准，都可以申请特定的文件，或者翻阅大厅里尘封已久的文件，但这一过程充满了官僚主义的纠葛。贿赂往往事半功倍，巨额贿赂可以说服记录者遗失甚至更改记录大厅中的文件。",
	"Valuable tomes are stored in vaults beneath the campus, including The Secret History of Sigil, a detailed account of the Fated's activities and the secrets its agents have learned. Volumes of this ongoing research project, especially recent ones, fetch a high price with opposing factions.": "校园地下的保险库里存放着许多珍贵的书籍，其中包括《西格尔秘史》，它详细记载了 \"命中注定 \"的活动以及其特工了解到的秘密。这项正在进行中的研究项目，尤其是最近的研究项目，在对立派别中价格不菲。",
	"Unsurprisingly, the underground compound is heavily defended. Within the campus lies a thrumming portal to Ysgard, a plane where might makes right and the Takers hoard their spoils. Giants stomp out of the portal to squash intruders in the name of the Fated, causing books and scrolls to quake in their lumbering wake.": "不出所料，这座地下建筑群防御森严。校园内有一个通往伊斯加德的传送门，在这个星球上，强者为尊，夺取者囤积居奇。巨人以宿命之名踏出传送门，击溃入侵者，使书籍和卷轴在他们的脚步声中颤抖。",
	"The Power of One": "一个人的力量",
	"The voices of Sigil ring out within the Hall of Speakers, where everyday complaints plant the seeds of laws.

	"Public hearings take place within the Speaker's Podium, a spacious chamber named after the wooden lecterns that dominate its stage. Though anyone can spectate, only the Council of Speakers can participate in these debates. Each ascendant faction in Sigil has at least one speaker: typically the factol and one or two other high-ranking members. However, speakers sometimes delegate their time behind the podium to an eloquent representative whom they trust to represent the faction's interests. The debates are largely performative affairs—hour-long bouts where faction representatives embarrass each other and themselves with thinly veiled insults, boasting, and magniloquent rhetoric. The factions of Sigil are rarely in agreement, and the few proposals voted into law by the Council of Speakers are either inconsequential or quickly overturned in favor of the status quo.": "公开听证会在议长讲坛内举行，这是一个宽敞的会议厅，因其舞台上的木制讲台而得名。虽然任何人都可以旁听，但只有议长会议才能参与这些辩论。西格尔的每个长老派系都至少有一名发言人：通常是长老和其他一到两名高级成员。不过，发言人有时也会把讲台后的时间委托给他们信任的能言善辩的代表，让他代表本派别的利益。辩论在很大程度上是表演性的，在长达数小时的辩论中，派系代表会用隐晦的侮辱、吹嘘和华丽的辞藻让对方和自己难堪。西格尔的派系很少能达成一致，议长会议表决通过的少数提案要么无关紧要，要么很快就被推翻以维持现状。",
	"Citizens can voice their opinions freely at the Trianym, a public forum located a block from the Hall of Speakers. The Trianym consists of three cylindrical platforms with seating for scribes and spectators to witness the exchanges. Locals reward shrewd debaters by tossing coins to them, reserving fistfuls of garbage for truly awful orators. The Trianym is more than a glorified soapbox—the thoughts that ferment in the Trianym pave the way for new factions and ways of thinking.": "公民可以在 Trianym 自由发表意见，这是一个公共论坛，与议长大厅相隔一个街区。Trianym 由三个圆柱形平台组成，平台上设有供抄写员和观众观看辩论的座位。当地人会向高明的辩论者投掷硬币以示奖励，而对于真正糟糕的演说者则会保留一捧垃圾。Trianym 不只是一个美化了的肥皂盒--在 Trianym 中发酵的思想为新的派别和思维方式铺平了道路。",
	"The onion-shaped cabs of Tea Street Transit shuttle customers throughout the Clerks' Ward. The proprietor is Kyl Silkfoot (lawful neutral, elf (%0%)), a crotchety elf with a raspy voice, easily spotted by the nauseating cloud of smoke that issues from his tarweed cigars.

	"The Tower Sorcerous is a spiny spire of unknown material, its surface shifting like a puddle of oil. The structure has no visible doors or windows save for eight balconies that jut from its twisting frame. Although the tower's surfaces are impenetrable to most, Incantifers step into the tower as if it were porous, leaving ripples behind them as they enter and emerge.": "巫师塔是一座由未知材料制成的尖塔，表面像一滩油一样晃动。除了从扭曲的框架中伸出的八个阳台外，这座建筑没有明显的门窗。虽然塔的表面对大多数人来说都是坚不可摧的，但巫师们踏入塔内时就好像它是多孔的一样，在他们进入和走出塔时都会在身后留下一圈圈涟漪。",
	"When the Tower Sorcerous disappeared from Sigil, it left behind an empty lot. The business that went up in its place, Fretter's Fetters and Fritters, was destroyed when the tower suddenly reappeared. Until recently, most folk believed the Lady of Pain consigned the tower and its inhabitants to the Mazes. Few know the circumstances of the tower's disappearance and reappearance, or what machinations brew within.": "巫师塔从西格尔消失后，留下了一片空地。弗瑞特的羁绊和油炸食品店在塔突然出现时被摧毁了。直到最近，大多数人都相信痛苦之女将塔和塔里的居民送进了迷宫。很少有人知道这座塔消失和再次出现的情况，也不知道塔内酝酿着什么阴谋。",
	"Neglected by the dabus and the generosity of other wards, the Hive Ward has fallen into disrepair. Its buildings are lopsided hodgepodges of architectural styles and materials, their floors haphazardly stacked atop one another to conserve space. The crooked high-rises darken cramped alleys, many of which are dead ends in more ways than one. Many residents of the city avoid the ward when possible, but those willing to risk the Hive can partake in its seedy establishments and hidden gems.": "在达布斯的忽视和其他病房的慷慨解囊下，蜂巢病房已经年久失修。这里的建筑是各种建筑风格和材料的 \"大杂烩\"，为了节省空间，楼层之间随意堆叠。歪歪扭扭的高楼遮蔽了狭窄的小巷，其中许多小巷都是死胡同。许多城市居民都尽可能避开该区，但那些愿意冒险进入蜂巢区的人则可以享受这里的肮脏场所和隐藏的珍宝。",
	"Crime is commonplace in the Hive. Grifters, cutpurses, and miscreants band together in the moldering streets, preying on the desperate and downtrodden. Pickpockets masquerade as touts, eager to pilfer coin from stumbling sots and newcomers. Professions not outwardly criminal in nature are often morally suspect, such as corpse collectors, opportunistic scavengers who scrape out a living by gathering bodies throughout the ward and delivering them to the Mortuary for meager payouts.": "在蜂巢，犯罪司空见惯。骗子、皮包客和歹徒在破败的街道上结伙作案，专挑绝望和落魄的人下手。扒手伪装成兜售者，热衷于从跌跌撞撞的乡巴佬和新来者那里偷窃钱财。拾尸者是一种投机取巧的拾荒者，他们通过在整个病房收集尸体并将其送到殡仪馆以换取微薄的报酬来谋生。",
	"Rain is more frequent in the Hive than elsewhere in Sigil, reflecting the ward's dismal mood. When it falls, gutters ooze sludge into brackish pools of oil and rainwater, their surfaces disturbed by scurrying cranium rats. Damp rags and swollen planks cover broken windows, blotting what little light ekes through the ward's perpetual fog.": "蜂巢区的雨水比锡吉尔其他地方更频繁，反映了该区凄凉的气氛。下起雨来，排水沟渗出的污泥变成一滩滩油渍和雨水，其表面被乱窜的颅鼠弄脏。潮湿的破布和肿胀的木板遮住了破碎的窗户，遮住了病房永恒迷雾中的一点光亮。",
	"Of all the wards in Sigil, the Hive Ward has the least oversight. Harmonium patrols are less frequent here, and peacekeepers have been known to avert their gaze from disreputable establishments. Though crime runs rampant, so do creativity and trade, and opportunities abound for those ready to seize them. Residents live unhampered by bureaucracy or judgment, free to pursue their deepest passions or indulge their guiltiest pleasures.": "在西格尔的所有病房中，蜂巢病房的监督最少。这里的 Harmonium 巡逻队并不频繁，而维和人员也会对不光彩的场所视而不见。虽然犯罪猖獗，但创造力和贸易也是如此，对于那些准备抓住机会的人来说，机会比比皆是。居民们的生活不受官僚主义或评判的影响，他们可以自由地追求内心深处的激情或放纵最罪恶的快乐。",
	"The following factions are headquartered in the Hive Ward:": "以下派系的总部位于蜂巢病房：",

Bleakers combat their existential dread with optimism and compassion, enriching the lives of those in and around the Hive through small acts of service. The faction maintains a network of safe havens throughout the ward where those in need can find refuge and a warm meal.": "在门屋内，凄凉派成员拒绝接受其他派别的哲学，认为多元宇宙毫无意义。凄凉派以乐观和同情心对抗生存的恐惧，通过微小的服务行动丰富蜂巢内外人们的生活。该派别在整个区内维持着一个安全避难所网络，有需要的人可以在那里找到庇护所和一顿热饭。",
	"Arson and vandalism are tools of the trade for the Hands of Havoc, a faction of rebels. In other wards, the Wreakers' destructive activities pave the way for reconstruction and renewal. In the Hive, however, Wreaker activity sometimes compounds the miseries of everyday life when their fires—vain attempts to garner attention from the movers and shakers of Sigil or burn away detritus within the ward—engulf the innocent. Rather than maintain a single base of operations, the Hands of Havoc operate out of warehouses strewn throughout the ward, moving constantly to evade Sigil's enforcers.": "纵火和破坏是反叛派别 \"浩劫之手 \"的惯用伎俩。在其他区，破坏者的破坏活动为重建和复兴铺平了道路。然而，在蜂巢区，破坏者的活动有时会加重日常生活的苦难，因为他们的大火--为了吸引西格尔区活动家的注意或烧毁区内的垃圾--会吞噬无辜的人。浩劫之手并没有维持一个单一的行动基地，而是在遍布整个病房的仓库中活动，不断移动以躲避西格尔的执法者。",
	"The Heralds of Dust are Sigil's undertakers. They conduct funerary rites for creatures from all places, ensuring their souls pass to the next stage of death undeterred. The bulk of the faction's workforce consists of skeletons, zombies, and other dull-minded Undead whose bodies were donated to the Mortuary by their owners in life. The Dusters rely on corpse collectors—grim-faced laborers found primarily in the Hive—to deliver a steady stream of bodies to them for interment.": "尘埃先驱是西格尔的殡葬师。他们为来自各地的生物举行葬礼，确保他们的灵魂安然进入死亡的下一阶段。该派系的大部分员工都是骷髅、僵尸和其他头脑迟钝的亡灵，他们生前的尸体都被主人捐献给了殡仪馆。除尘者主要依靠蜂巢中面目狰狞的收尸人将尸体源源不断地运送给他们安葬。",

Deliberately grown razorvine creeps along the structure's bladed balconies and lower walls, deterring thieves who seek to steal the weapons within. Heavy metal gates bar its few windows, and a relief of a menacing horned skull—the faction's symbol—hangs over its main entrance within. Day and night, the Armory's chimneys belch smoke and flame.": "末日守卫的总部设在军械库，这是一个位于下城区边界的不祥据点。刻意种植的剃刀藤爬满了建筑的刀锋阳台和下部墙壁，威慑着那些想偷走里面武器的小偷。厚重的金属大门挡住了为数不多的几扇窗户，内部的主入口处悬挂着一个气势汹汹的角骷髅浮雕--这是派别的标志。无论白天黑夜，军械库的烟囱都冒着浓烟和火焰。",
	"A colossal forge dominates the first floor of the Armory, which is open to the public. Mercenaries, mongers, and other curious buyers gawk at industrious smithies accustomed to the forge's unbearable temperatures. Azers, fire elementals, and chain devils number among the Armory's blacksmiths, along with dwarves and other Doomguard smiths.": "军械库的一楼是一个巨大的锻造场，对公众开放。佣兵、商人和其他好奇的买家目不转睛地盯着勤劳的铁匠们，他们已经习惯了锻造场难以忍受的温度。军械库的铁匠中有阿泽尔、火元素和链魔，还有矮人和其他末日守卫铁匠。",
	"Aslan Ashfang, a lawful neutral (%0%) merchant from the City of Brass, emerges from the forge's coals to greet potential buyers. A clever and convincing salesman, Aslan brokers deals between the Doomguard and interested parties. The dapper efreeti knows every weapon in the Sinker catalog and its price, from delicate jeweled daggers to massive siege weapons. Items small enough to display—or their replicas if too precious or dangerous—are showcased in an exhibition hall just inside the Armory.": "阿斯兰-阿什方（Aslan Ashfang）是黄铜城的合法中立商人（%0%），他从锻造炉的炭火中走出来迎接潜在的买家。阿斯兰是个聪明而令人信服的推销员，他为末日守卫和感兴趣的人之间的交易牵线搭桥。这位潇洒的埃弗里蒂人对沉沦魔目录中的每件武器及其价格都了如指掌，从精致的宝石匕首到巨大的攻城武器。小到可以展示的武器，大到过于珍贵或危险的复制品，都在军械库内的展览厅中展示。",
	"Beyond the forge lie four heavily guarded chambers, each containing a portal to a fortress on the edge of one of the Inner Planes. Within these citadels, the four doom lords—high-ranking faction lieutenants with powers of entropy and destruction—observe the multiverse and its beauteous decay. From these citadels, members of the Doomguard launch expeditions to hunt or capture destructive monsters across the multiverse, testing their skills against terrifying creatures and deadly extremes.": "锻造室外有四个守卫森严的密室，每个密室都有一个通往内行星边缘堡垒的入口。在这些堡垒中，四位末日领主--拥有熵和毁灭力量的高级派系副官--观察着多元宇宙及其美丽的衰变。末日守卫的成员从这些城堡出发，在多元宇宙中猎杀或捕捉毁灭性的怪物，在可怕的生物和致命的极端环境中考验他们的技能。",
	"The Armory sells every weapon, shield, and armor in the (%0%) at normal cost. At the DM's discretion, the Armory might have other armaments available for sale, such as (%1%) for 300 gp apiece.": "军械库以正常价格出售（%0%）中的所有武器、盾牌和盔甲。根据 DM 的判断，军械库可能会出售其他武器，比如 (%1%) 每件售价 300 便士。",
	"Hushed streets surround the Barracks, a wide compound of cold granite at the opposite end of the Lady's Ward from the Armory. Stoic and impenetrable, the lofty fortress houses the rank and file of the Harmonium, Sigil's militant guards and enforcers. Taciturn sentries march along its spiked, gray-slate roof, gazing over a largely deserted precinct. Life this close to the Hardheads is a double-edged sword. While local businesses—of which there are few—enjoy on-demand security, their proprietors must be spotless in the eyes of the law or suffer crackdowns from overzealous disciplinarians in the faction, who enforce Factol Sarin's orders without question.": "军营周围是寂静的街道，它是由冰冷的花岗岩砌成的宽阔建筑群，与军械库遥遥相对。这座巍峨的堡垒坚毅而难以逾越，里面驻扎着西吉尔好战的卫兵和执法者--哈蒙尼姆（Harmonium）的官兵。沉默寡言的哨兵沿着尖尖的灰色石板屋顶行进，凝视着大面积荒废的辖区。如此接近 \"硬头党 \"的生活是一把双刃剑。虽然当地的企业（为数不多）可以享受随叫随到的安保服务，但这些企业的经营者在法律面前必须一尘不染，否则就会遭到该派别中过于热心的纪律人员的镇压，他们会不容置疑地执行萨林教官的命令。",
	"The Barracks are open to all enthusiastic peacekeepers, though Hardheads stop and interrogate anyone who ventures past the clasped stone hands over the stronghold's arched entrance. Straitlaced recruiters pressure visitors without a clear faction allegiance to enlist in the Harmonium and reap its benefits.": "军营向所有热心的和平捍卫者开放，但凡是经过据点拱形入口处那双紧握的石手的人，都会被 \"硬头军 \"拦下盘问。奸诈的征兵人员会向没有明确派别的来访者施压，要求他们加入 Harmonium 并从中获益。",
	"Composed of four identical sections and the squat towers that join them, the Barracks surround a wide parade ground. The Harmonium shows its strength within the quad through drills, marches, and other ceremonial displays. Beyond the grounds lie classrooms and living quarters, along with the faction's archives, which include current and past Harmonium patrol routes, active members and their ranks, and official arrest records.": "军营由四个相同的部分和连接它们的蹲式塔楼组成，环绕着一个宽阔的阅兵场。军营通过操练、游行和其他仪式展示自己的实力。场地外是教室和生活区，以及该派别的档案馆，其中包括当前和过去的 Harmonium 巡逻路线、现役成员及其军衔以及官方逮捕记录。",
	"With an official writ from Factol Sarin, the factol of an allied faction, or an influential figure in Sigil, one can gain temporary protection services or extra muscle in the form of a few reliable guards who stubbornly obey every city ordinance.": "只要得到萨林教长、盟友教长或西格尔城中有影响力的人物的正式命令，就能获得临时保护服务或额外的力量，比如几名可靠的卫兵，他们会顽固地遵守每一条城市法令。",
	"Luck abounds at Fortune's Wheel, an extravagant casino and favored hotspot in the Lady's Ward. It's run by (%0%) (see (%1%)), a vain and ambitious yugoloth crime lord of multiversal renown. Rarely spotted in the common areas of the gambling hall, the arcanaloth is the picture of wealth, power, and influence, always dressed to the nines and crowned with a spidery razorvine headdress. In Shemeshka's eyes, the establishment's profits pale in comparison to its true spoils: secrets gleaned by her web of spies, both those employed in the casino and others enacting her far-reaching schemes.": "幸运之轮赌场（Fortune's Wheel）是一个奢华的赌场，也是女士病房（Lady's Ward）的热门场所。赌场由 (%0%) （见 (%1%)）经营，他是一个虚荣、野心勃勃的尤古洛斯犯罪头目，在多个世界都享有盛名。在赌博大厅的公共区域很少能看到他的身影，他是财富、权力和影响力的象征，总是衣冠楚楚，头戴蛛网状的剃刀头饰。在谢美什卡眼中，赌场的利润与真正的战利品相比显得微不足道：她的间谍网收集到的秘密，既包括赌场雇佣的间谍，也包括为她实施影响深远的计划的其他人。",
	"Like moths to a candle, risk takers gravitate to the buzzing marquee of Fortune's Wheel. The polished revolving door of this recently renovated building opens into the historic Dragon Bar, a modest tavern named for the carved dragon head that watches over it. Beyond this reception area and its alert bouncers lies the casino proper.": "就像飞蛾扑火一样，冒险家们都喜欢光顾 \"财富之轮 \"的招牌。在这座新近翻修的建筑里，一扇锃亮的旋转门通向历史悠久的龙吧，这是一家规模不大的酒馆，因其上方的龙头雕刻而得名。过了接待区和警惕的保镖，就是赌场了。",
	"Games of chance line the luxurious carpeted casino hall, which thrums with a chorus of shuffling cards, rattling dice, and whirring clockwork slot machines. These games take razorleaf gambling chips, golden tokens that bear a stylized razorvine emblem.": "铺着奢华地毯的赌场大厅里，洗牌声、掷骰子声、老虎机声此起彼伏。这些游戏都使用剃刀叶赌博筹码，也就是印有剃刀徽章的金色代币。",
	"Every evening, performances grace an ornate, curtained stage, but the real star of the casino is its namesake: the fortune's wheel, a three-tiered, standing roulette wheel where inheritances are squandered and made. Weapons and luck-altering magic are prohibited within the casino, but the staff enforces the policy only in the most blatant of violations.": "每天晚上，华丽的幕布舞台上都会有精彩的表演，但赌场真正的明星是它的名字：财富之轮，一个三层的立式轮盘，在这里可以挥霍和赚取遗产。赌场内禁止使用武器和改变运气的魔术，但工作人员只在最公然违反规定的情况下才执行这一政策。",
	"Known to few and hidden within the casino are the Platinum Rooms, a collection of demiplanar chambers where interplanar fat cats wager ancient artifacts, trapped souls, and the fates of entire worlds. Accessible only to bigwigs trusted with special portal keys, the Platinum Rooms feature a rogue's gallery of some of the multiverse's most dangerous players.": "赌场中隐藏着白金厅，这里是星际肥猫们赌上古文物、被困灵魂和整个世界命运的地方，很少有人知道白金厅的存在。只有拥有特殊传送门钥匙的大人物才能进入白金厅，这里汇集了多元宇宙中最危险的玩家。",
	"Fortune's Wheel is further detailed in the adventure (%0%).": "财富之轮在冒险（%0%）中有更详细的介绍。",
	"Sparkling rays converge on the stained-glass windows of Heart's Fire, a luminous temple devoted to gods of fire, truth, and light. Golden, wavy blades hover atop the house of worship like flames. Nicknamed the Sun of Sigil, it glows each day at dawn.": "闪闪发光的光线汇聚在心之火的彩色玻璃窗上，这是一座专门供奉火神、真理之神和光明之神的光辉寺庙。金色的波浪形叶片像火焰一样盘旋在神殿顶端。它的绰号是西格尔的太阳，每天黎明时分都会发光。",
	"Recently, Heart's Fire has become the subject of gossip throughout the Temple District. The temple's former high priest, a (%0%) named Ephemera, was called away on a divine errand. Before departing, the angel appointed a controversial replacement to guide the fane in their stead: Mihr, a lawful good (%1%) who turned their back on the Nine Hells long ago. Kind and merciful, the new high priest hopes the congregation will see their redeemed nature, but some of the temple's clergy refuse to accept Mihr as the true high priest.": "最近，\"心之火 \"成了整个圣殿区的八卦话题。神殿的前任大祭司，一位名叫 Ephemera（%0%）的天使被召去执行一项神圣的任务。临行前，天使任命了一位备受争议的接替者，代替他们领导神殿： 米尔，一个很久以前就背弃了九层地狱的合法好人（%1%）。新任大祭司善良仁慈，希望信徒们能看到他们被救赎的本性，但神殿中的一些神职人员拒绝接受米尔为真正的大祭司。",
	"The scales of justice are balanced at the High Courts of Sigil, headquarters of the Fraternity of Order. The courthouse is a dignified edifice hewn from flawless, white marble with towers that rise from the structure's bladed gables. Granite steps ascend the courthouse's elevated entrance, above which hangs a triangular pediment. Etched within the architrave is the faction's motto: \"Knowledge is power.\"": "西吉尔高等法院是秩序博爱会的总部，在这里，正义的天平得到了平衡。法院是一座庄严的建筑，由无瑕的白色大理石凿成，塔楼从建筑的刃形屋檐上拔地而起。花岗岩台阶沿着法院高架入口拾级而上，入口上方悬挂着三角形的楣板。拱形门楣上镌刻着该派别的座右铭：\"知识就是力量\"。",
	"Though absolute authority in Sigil belongs to the Lady of Pain, most legal matters are settled in the city's tribunals, often decided by a single, supposedly impartial magistrate appointed by the Guvners. Punishments are tailored to fit the crime, and advocates are strongly encouraged. Lawyers and orators, these civil servants include bards, faction agents, and devils with a knack for navigating the subtleties of the law.": "虽然西格尔的绝对权威属于痛苦女士，但大多数法律事务都由城市的法庭解决，通常由 Guvners 任命的一名所谓公正的裁判官裁决。法庭根据罪行量身定制惩罚措施，并大力鼓励辩护律师。律师和演说家，这些公务员包括吟游诗人、派系代理人和精通法律微妙之处的魔鬼。",
	"While cheap advocates linger on the courthouse steps hoping to find work, their arguments are brittle. Brilliant barristers demand high retainers, but they're worth every coin when the alternative is a visit from the Mercykillers. One talented attorney is \"Sly\" Nye (chaotic neutral, tiefling (%0%)), who claims to have never lost a case. Sly has been known to waive their astronomical fee for adventurers who help gather evidence relevant to other cases. Of course, the accused are always free to represent themselves.": "当廉价的辩护人徘徊在法院的台阶上希望找到工作时，他们的论据却很脆弱。出色的大律师需要支付高额的聘金，但如果换来的是怜悯杀戮者的来访，他们就物有所值了。天才律师 \"斯莱\"-奈（混乱中立者，铁皮人（%0%））就是其中之一，他自称从未输过官司。众所周知，对于帮助收集其他案件相关证据的冒险者，斯莱会免除他们天价的费用。当然，被告可以自由地为自己辩护。",
	"The rear tower consists primarily of lesser courts, which resound with procedural bickering and the rapping of gavels. More serious offenses are prosecuted in the Grand Court, a noble chamber darkened by severe judges and their righteous verdicts. Any of the following three judges might preside over a trial in the Grand Court:": "后塔主要由较小的法庭组成，法庭里充斥着程序性的争吵和法槌的敲击声。更严重的罪行在大法庭起诉，严厉的法官和他们正义的判决使这个高贵的法庭变得昏暗。以下三位法官中的任何一位都可能主持大法庭的审判：",

	"Elsewhere within the High Courts lies the Hall of Concordance, an embassy of law where contracts are forged under the unblinking eyes of the inevitables, constructs created by the modron deity Primus to bring order to dealings between planar folk. Inside, the Kolyarut, an engine of absolute order, ratifies contracts on sheets of solid gold, leaving their enforcement to the inexorable (%0%) (detailed in (%1%)) and truth-seeking components of itself, also dubbed (%2%) (see (%3%)). Rule breakers who violate these sacred contracts are tracked down and banished to a teleportation circle in the hall.": "在高等法院的其他地方，有一个法律使馆--协约厅（Hall of Concordance），这里的合同是在 \"不可避免者\"（the inevitables）的眼皮底下签订的。\"不可避免者 \"是由模因神灵普里莫斯（Primus）创造的，目的是为星球居民之间的交易带来秩序。在这里，科里亚鲁特（Kolyarut）是绝对秩序的发动机，它在纯金的纸张上批准契约，并将其交给无情的（%0%）（详见（%1%））和寻求真相的（%2%）（详见（%3%））来执行。违反这些神圣契约的规则破坏者会被追踪并放逐到大厅中的传送圈。",
	"Ominous chants echo in the Infinite Well, a temple to the Abyss and its untold layers. The temple hovers high above the surrounding houses of worship, floating above a seemingly bottomless pit. Tarnished blades jut from the Infinite Well like metal branches on a blackened tree. Rather than the blue-green verdigris common throughout the city, blood trickles down the temple's rusted spikes. The temple's interior is a gloomy sanctuary of stained altars, menacing iron chandeliers, and sputtering black candles.": "不祥的颂歌在无尽之井中回荡，这是一座通往深渊及其无尽深渊的神庙。神庙高高悬浮在周围的礼拜堂之上，漂浮在看似无底的深渊之上。褪色的刀片从无尽之井中伸出，就像漆黑大树上的金属树枝。鲜血顺着神庙生锈的尖刺滴落，而不是城市中常见的蓝绿色翠绿。神庙内部是一个阴暗的圣殿，到处都是污迹斑斑的祭坛、气势汹汹的铁制吊灯和喷涌而出的黑色蜡烛。",
	"Because there are infinite layers to the Abyss, there are infinite demon lords among them to be venerated. As a result, the cultists of the temple are a disorganized mess, and daily sacrifices sourced from among the faithful cause their numbers to dwindle. Intent on improving their reputation and converting new members to their sinister fold, the fanatics of the Infinite Well don insincere smiles and prove unflinchingly positive as they evangelize in public.": "因为深渊有无限层，所以其中有无限的恶魔领主需要供奉。因此，神庙中的邪教徒组织混乱，每天从信徒中募集的祭品使他们的人数不断减少。无尽之井的狂热者们一心想提高自己的声誉，让新成员加入他们邪恶的阵营，因此他们在公开场合传教时都带着虚伪的笑容，表现出坚定不移的积极态度。",
	"A single grim blemish of gray stone and metal rises above Sigil's resplendent courthouses. Headquarters of the Mercykillers, the Prison is a warning to wrongdoers of the full penalty of law. The Prison's architecture is anathema to hope and light. During the dark and twilight hours, glaring searchlights affixed to the penitentiary's barbed watchtowers scan the ward below for runaways, but all that escapes its walls are the wails of the prisoners within.": "在西格尔辉煌的法院之上，耸立着一个由灰色石头和金属组成的狰狞污点。监狱是慈悲杀手的总部，它警示不法之徒将受到法律的严惩。监狱的建筑是对希望和光明的诅咒。在黑夜和黄昏时分，安装在监狱铁丝网瞭望塔上的刺眼探照灯会扫描下面的病房，寻找逃犯，但监狱的墙壁上只有囚犯的哀嚎。",
	"Engineered to contain all manner of planar convicts, the Prison's cells vary by block. Fire elementals and arsonists are sealed in frigid cells, while giants are issued with magic collars that sap their might and reduce them to diminutive statures. Grudges fester in bleak cells, and fights regularly break out between inmates in mess halls and common areas.": "监狱的设计可以关押各种类型的平面罪犯，牢房因区块而异。火元素和纵火犯被关在寒冷的牢房里，而巨人则被戴上魔法项圈，以消耗他们的力量，使他们变得矮小。怨恨在阴暗的牢房中发酵，囚犯之间经常在食堂和公共区域发生争斗。",
	"Particularly dangerous criminals never leave their cells, which are suspended in high-security units that hang from the Prison's exterior like inverted buttresses.

	"Mercykillers torment rebellious inmates in the Cellars, the Prison's dark undercroft. Desperate scratches mar the dungeon's blood-red chambers, where prisoners are dragged to but sometimes never return. When an inmate proves especially resilient or dangerous, the Mercykillers banish them to the Hole, a cylindrical cell block of isolated demiplanes suffused with antimagic.": "慈悲杀手在地窖--监狱黑暗的地下室--折磨反叛的囚犯。地牢血红的密室里到处都是绝望的抓痕，囚犯们被拖到这里，有时却再也回不来了。当囚犯证明自己特别顽强或危险时，怜悯杀戮者就会把他们放逐到 \"洞穴\"，这是一个充满反魔法的圆柱形隔离囚室。",
	"Notorious criminals, interplanar outlaws, cosmic warlords, and other threats to the multiverse are incarcerated in the Prison. Examples of inmates appear in the Prison Inmates table.": "臭名昭著的罪犯、星际逃犯、宇宙军阀以及其他对多元宇宙构成威胁的人都被关进了监狱。囚犯示例请参见监狱囚犯表。",

Iron walls encircle the fortified town, and two rows of cracked, dry spires of rock curl over its arid sky—the earthen ribs from which the gate-town derives its name. Ribcage's menacing, arched gates, festooned with wings like those of a bat and forged from infernal steel, allude to the power of the Lords of the Nine Hells.": "肋骨镇是脊骨谷黑乎乎的中心地带，这里是一片参差不齐的荒山，山峰围绕着一个冒着黑烟的山谷向内弯曲。铁墙环绕着这座坚固的城镇，两排干裂的岩石尖顶在干旱的天空中袅袅升起，这就是这座门镇名字的由来。肋骨城的拱形大门气势汹汹，门上装饰着蝙蝠的翅膀，由地狱之钢锻造而成，彰显着九层地狱领主的力量。",
	"Bound to the Nine Hells and its rigid hierarchy of backstabbing Fiends, Ribcage obeys a strict but mobile caste system. Stratified by morality, residents climb the rungs of society through guile, treachery, and devilish deals to obtain power at any cost.

	"To prevent the gate-town from becoming so evil that it experiences a cosmic realignment, Duchess Zelza Zurkbane (lawful evil (%0%)) and her senators have enacted a policy limiting the number of devils in Ribcage. A succubus in a suit and tie, Duchess Zurkbane masquerades as a tiefling arbiter. Severed unicorn horns support the soles of her clacking obsidian heels, and her briefcase—a subservient (%1%)—snaps open to reveal a drooling maw of jagged teeth. Her Excellency rarely shows her true form and keeps her abilities secret, preferring to drain her victims through legal proceedings and blackmail.

Surrounded by silvery ash—said to be all that remains of those who challenged archdevils and lost—the fiery pillar transports entrants to the desolate wastelands of Avernus, the war-torn first layer of the Nine Hells. Clever Fiends and mages can change the gate's destination, warping the pillar into an icy mirror that leads to the glacial layer of Cania or a noxious cloud leading to the rotting bog of Minauros. Only Asmodeus, Archduke of Nessus, can link the pillar to the lowest layer of the Nine Hells.": "熊熊燃烧的红色火焰柱在城镇中心的灰烬城堡中旋转。炽热的柱子被银色的灰烬环绕，据说这是那些挑战大恶魔却失败的人的全部遗物，它将进入者传送到荒凉的阿弗纳斯荒原，九层地狱中饱受战争蹂躏的第一层。聪明的恶魔和法师可以改变大门的目的地，将火柱扭曲成一面通往卡尼亚冰川层的冰镜，或是一片通往米瑙罗斯腐烂沼泽的毒云。只有内瑟斯大公阿斯莫德才能将石柱连接到九层地狱的最底层。",

	"Located just outside the town walls, the Gymnasium of Steam provides respite to weary travelers who have business in Ribcage but want to avoid the duchess and her oligarchs. The resort leverages a network of scalding geysers and terraced volcanic springs to create a paradise of steam rooms, saunas, and luxurious baths.

Eight octagonal iron walls, menacing and impenetrable, divide the town into seven stacked rings festooned with banners of war. Advanced siege weapons are anchored to their angular battlements. Soldiers rise at the crack of dawn to the punctual call of brass horns, filling the gate-town's tented circuits with the drum of marching boots and cadence calls sung by warriors honing their bodies for an unending war.": "将军们在里格斯（Rigus）燃起战火，这是一个与战斗和血腥平面相连的永久性军事营地。里格斯镇层层叠叠地建在一座坚固的山上，是一座军事力量的纪念碑。八面八角形的铁墙气势汹汹、坚不可摧，将小镇分成七个层层叠叠的圆环，上面挂满了战争的旗帜。先进的攻城武器被固定在棱角分明的城垛上。天刚蒙蒙亮，士兵们就在铜管号角声中准时起床，城门镇的帐篷里充满了军靴的鼓声和战士们为无休止的战争磨练身体而唱出的军歌。",
	"Rigus follows a strict military hierarchy in which everyone has a rank. Commoners and green recruits come in as privates, the lowest designation in the gate-town save for prisoners of war. Their arms tire from saluting their superiors and thankless, menial work. Citizens are expected to comply with orders from commanding officers, who don't tolerate disobedience lightly. With time and dedication, ambitious cadets can graduate to respected positions. Accomplished adventurers quickly ascend the ladder, but unproven visitors—called \"slates\" after the blank, chalk-white badges they wear within the town—are paid little attention.": "里格斯遵循严格的军事等级制度，每个人都有军衔。平民和新兵入伍时都是二等兵，这是城门镇除战俘外最低的军衔。他们的手臂因向上司敬礼和从事吃力不讨好的琐碎工作而疲惫不堪。市民们必须服从指挥官的命令，而指挥官不会轻易容忍违抗命令的行为。只要付出时间和心血，雄心勃勃的学员就能晋升到受人尊敬的职位。有成就的冒险者很快就能得到晋升，但未经证实的来访者--他们在镇子里佩戴的空白粉笔白徽章被称为 \"石板\"--则很少受到关注。",

Clad in crimson plate, the general pays homage to the Red Knight, a god of strategy whom he reveres. Deep down, Braahg hates war and all its destruction. Stern and contemplative, he moves the pawns in his war tent with deliberation, knowing each toppled piece represents thousands of casualties. The pensive general harbors many secrets, the darkest of which can end entire worlds. Braahg's disdain for the conflict he oversees is counter to the gate-town's warlike nature and tempers Rigus just enough to keep it in the Outlands.": "六位王室将军是里杰卡尔德的高层。他们是经验丰富的战术家，拥有数百年的战场经验，指挥着各国的军队。其中布拉格将军（合法中立 (%0%)）是一位来自托瑞尔世界的宽肩灰发指挥官。这位将军身着深红色的军装，向他崇敬的战略之神--红骑士致敬。在内心深处，布拉格憎恨战争和战争带来的一切破坏。他严厉而沉思，深思熟虑地移动战帐中的棋子，因为他知道每一颗棋子的倒下都代表着成千上万人的伤亡。这位沉思的将军隐藏着许多秘密，其中最黑暗的秘密可以毁灭整个世界。布拉格对他所监管的冲突不屑一顾，这与门镇的好战本性背道而驰，他对里杰卡尔德的脾气调节得恰到好处，使其得以继续留在外域。",

While there's plenty of room to quarter soldiers above ground, generals find the cramped tunnel conditions foster more aggressive warriors. Life in the bunkers is mandatory for the gate-town's rank and file, but visitors typically prefer to stay at the Broken Slate, an enduring surface tavern.": "里古斯基本上放弃了旅馆和酒馆，转而使用地堡，这是一个由兵营和食堂组成的地下建筑群，除了城门最顶端的环形地堡外，其他地方都与地堡相连。虽然地面上有足够的空间供士兵驻扎，但将军们发现狭窄的地道条件会培养出更具侵略性的战士。地下掩体的生活是城门镇官兵的必修课，但游客通常更喜欢住在 \"破碎的石板\"，这是一家经久不衰的地面酒馆。",

	"The gate to Limbo shifts with the town, changing shape and location at indeterminate intervals. In the morning, it might be the glaring eye of a cyclopean statue. By night, it could be a freestanding door, humming softly in the middle of a river of sluggish lava. Other times, the gate takes bizarre forms, such as a dull liquid in an antique chalice that must be sipped to transport creatures, or a sassy, sapient mouth that admits only those who reveal a titillating secret to it. Regardless of its form, the gate isn't hard to identify; chaos swells around the portal—the eye of a maelstrom of change.": "通往地狱之门随着城市的变迁而变化，每隔一段不确定的时间就会改变形状和位置。清晨，它可能是一尊独眼巨人雕像炯炯有神的眼睛。到了晚上，它可能是一扇独立的门，在缓缓流淌的熔岩河中发出轻轻的嗡嗡声。其他时候，大门会以奇异的形式出现，比如古董杯中的沉闷液体，必须喝一口才能运送生物；或者是一张时髦的有灵性的嘴，只有向它透露撩人秘密的人才能进入。无论其形态如何，大门都不难辨认；入口周围混沌涌动，就像变化漩涡的眼睛。",

Now, the Cube exists in a constant state of flux, an undulating, four-dimensional mass of repeating fractals and micrified contours.
