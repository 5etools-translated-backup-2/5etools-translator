	"Initially published in 1974, Dungeons & Dragons was the world's first role-playing game and would go on to revolutionize all aspects of the gaming industry and pop culture alongside it. It introduced an array of now-pervasive gaming concepts, from leveling up to gamified role assumption, but it notably held on to some aspects of its war-gaming past. Born out of a gaming culture that prized realistic simulation, the notion of needing food was inherent in the earliest versions of the game, usually represented in the simple tracking of weekly rations. To have any hope of surviving a protracted excursion in the dungeon underworld, you needed to stay fed. Simply put, in D&D, you must eat to live. But adventurers also needed a place to meet, carouse, and gather information, and what better venues to place in front of them than taverns, public houses, and other places of food and drink?": "龙与地下城》最初出版于 1974 年，是世界上第一款角色扮演游戏，随后彻底改变了游戏产业和流行文化的方方面面。它引入了从等级提升到游戏化角色假设等一系列现在普遍存在的游戏概念，但值得注意的是，它保留了过去战争游戏的某些方面。诞生于崇尚真实模拟的游戏文化，食物需求的概念在最早的游戏版本中就已存在，通常表现为每周口粮的简单追踪。要想在地下城的长期游历中存活下来，就必须保持充足的食物。简单地说，在 D&D 中，你必须吃东西才能活下去。但是冒险者们也需要一个聚会、狂欢和收集信息的地方，还有什么比酒馆、公馆和其他吃喝玩乐的地方更好的呢？",

	"Why so many options for an element of realism that could just as simply check the box? Perhaps it's because early designers realized that food could provide new avenues for the narrative experience. Would a haughty aristocrat be content with iron rations?

From bustling port-side cities to sprawling pastoral landscapes, the game is full of real-world influences, and this is also true of what adventurers may eat. Whether your character frequents the taverns of the Forgotten Realms, the castles of Greyhawk, or the forests of Krynn, there's a good chance you'll see something familiar on the menu.

While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major Faerûnian trade routes.

	"Many examinations of early Yawning Portal menus have noted that its heavy, often greasy, fare had a celebratory \"last meal\" sense about it. This is likely because return from the Undermountain was simply not expected, with only the soiled dishware of stout adventurers left behind. However, as more adventurers survived the mad mage Halaster's labyrinth, the menu evolved to accommodate a balance of healthier options. Senior cook Jarandur Tallstand adapted the traditional wood-elven forest salad, or chopforest, as it has been called, to complement the heavier menu options with its mix of peppered leaves, olives, fennel, and tangy vinaigrette dressing.

	"Popular at holiday gatherings of humans and elves alike, sornstag is a simmered venison dish that can be seasoned and prepared in a variety of ways. Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road.": "在人类和精灵的节日聚会上，Sornstag 都很受欢迎，这是一道用鹿肉煨制的菜肴，可以用多种方法调味和烹制。传统的精灵炖鹿肉是在浓汤中加入磨碎的香菜、孜然、辣香料或咖喱慢慢熏制而成，是木精灵在丰收节期间最受欢迎的一道菜。人类也采用了自己的炖煮技术来烹制这种野味浓郁但肉质鲜美的主菜。在法厄恩的森林地区，人类猎杀雄鹿，既是为了运动，也是为了进餐，因此以鹿肉为主的菜肴大量出现。在达勒恩森林和田野中，最受欢迎的 Sornstag 地区食谱需要一整天的准备时间。传统食谱要求将杏仁粉与红酒一起熬煮，形成辛辣酱汁的乳化基底，将肉浸泡在其中过夜，然后从黎明开始在明火上慢炖，在傍晚时分享用。 不过，要想更快地把鹿肉端上餐桌，您可以省去隔夜腌制的工序，只需在烤箱里烤上几个小时即可。值得注意的是，埃森布拉的银酒窖（Silver Taproom）吸引了来自四面八方的旅行者，他们争相品尝这里著名的炖鹿肉馅饼（pied sornstag）。当香气扑鼻的馅饼飘散在熙熙攘攘的劳特霍威尔路上时，您就知道炖鹿肉馅饼做好了。",
	"One silver piece is an extraordinary bargain for the Rothé Steak at the Yawning Portal—even if it is one of the more expensive things on the menu. Served sizzling-hot right out of the skillet, with just a hint of garlic and garden spices, rothé steak is a carnivore's delight and the perfect protein for a triumphant or aspiring adventurer. Along the Sword Coast, you can easily source fresh (%0%) that is either farm-raised or wild game—there are devotees of both. Why bother with any vegetable sides? You won't get to them with this slab of meat to tackle.": "用一两银子就能在打哈欠入口处吃到罗塞牛排，即使它是菜单上最贵的菜之一，也是非常划算的。刚出锅的罗塞牛排热气腾腾，略带大蒜和花园香料的味道，是肉食动物的最爱，也是胜利者或有抱负的冒险家的最佳蛋白质。在剑海岸，您可以轻松买到农场饲养或野生的新鲜（%0%）野味，这两种野味都很受欢迎。为什么还要配菜呢？有了这块肉，您就不会再去吃它们了。",
	"The onion loaf on the menu at the Yawning Portal is done in the Cormyr style: big, dark loaves, as dense as the King's Forest. While the onion may be the headliner, the real stars of the show are the leeks, scallions, and fresh buttermilk, which help round out the flavors of this rich, crusty loaf—perfect for morningfeast or eveningfeast. When it's time to break bread with adventuring companions, old and new, an onion loaf is an inexpensive and delicious option that's practically a meal in itself.": "打哈欠之门餐厅菜单上的洋葱面包是按照科米尔的风格制作的：又大又黑的面包，像国王的森林一样致密。虽然洋葱可能是主角，但真正的主角是韭菜、葱和新鲜的黄油牛奶，它们让这款口感浓郁、外皮酥脆的面包风味更佳，是早晚餐的完美之选。当需要与新老探险伙伴一起分享面包时，洋葱面包是一种既便宜又美味的选择，它本身几乎就是一顿饭。",
	"It's rare to see this halfling specialty on the table, usually because it's gone before you ever catch a glimpse of it. Perfect for morningfeast, or teatime, the much-celebrated sour cream-walnut cake includes a delicious crumble of cinnamon, brown sugar, and walnuts, but it's the cake itself that takes the cake. A recipe passed down orally by generations of halflings, it is said to be made with the finest Luiren grain flour, fresh sour cream, and finely ground kaeth or coffee. The only known issue with the pastry is that there never seems to be enough of it.": "很少能在餐桌上看到这种半身人特产，通常是因为你还没看到它，它就已经消失了。酸奶油核桃蛋糕非常适合早饭或茶点时间食用，它包括美味的肉桂碎、红糖和核桃，但蛋糕本身才是最重要的。半身人世代口口相传的配方，据说是用最好的卢仁谷物面粉、新鲜酸奶油和磨细的凯斯或咖啡制成的。唯一已知的问题是，蛋糕似乎永远都不够吃。",
	"The Yawning Portal of Waterdeep serves a new pie every week, based on the seasonal ingredients available. You're really in luck when laumberries from the frosty Frozenfar are in season. Their tartness is softened by the sweetness of the dough, making it the perfect blend of flavors. The famous tavern likely pilfered the idea from the hardy bakers of Bryn Shander. Pies in this style are made off-season with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, which together give you something of the flavor of the original. They're best served a bit chilled, and when done right have been known to resurrect the spirits of weary adventurers emerging from the Undermountain.": "水深城的打哈欠之门每周都会根据时令食材供应新派。当冰霜之远的橘子成熟时节，您就真的走运了。面团的甜味软化了它们的酸味，使各种口味完美融合。这家有名的酒馆很可能是从布林山德（Bryn Shander）勤劳的面包师那里剽窃来的创意。这种馅饼是在淡季用蓝莓、黑莓和覆盆子制作的，这三种水果搭配在一起就能做出原汁原味的馅饼。冰镇后食用效果更佳，如果制作得当，还能让疲惫不堪的冒险者从地下山中重新振作起来。",
	"While conventionally prepared with a base of (%0%) milk, other types of milk such as yak milk, buttermilk, rice milk, and even nut milk are all suitable substitutes in this creamy, cozy concoction. But no matter which milk you choose, there is no alternative for Mingari spice, culled from the inner bark of Mingari trees. Likened in both flavor and scent to cinnamon, Mingari spice is a rare but highly sought-after seasoning indigenous to southeast Faerûn. Although rare, this strong, aromatic spice is incredibly versatile, at home in both sweet and savory dishes, and thus it has spread throughout the Realms and beyond. However, satisfying Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk requires merely a dash of this scarce but potent accent. Travelers in search of a day starter, an alcohol-infused night capper, or even a medicinal stomach soother, invariably relish a tall mug of this nourishing milk.": "虽然传统做法是以牛奶（%0%）为基料，但牦牛奶、酪乳、米浆甚至坚果奶等其他类型的牛奶都可以替代这种奶香浓郁、口感舒适的调料。但是，无论您选择哪种牛奶，明加里香料都是不可替代的，明加里香料取自明加里树的内皮。明加里香料的味道和香味都类似肉桂，是一种稀有但非常抢手的调味料，产于法厄恩东南部。虽然稀有，但这种浓郁芳香的香料用途极广，在甜味和咸味菜肴中都能找到它的身影，因此它已经传遍了王国内外。然而，要满足明加利香料猫头鹰奶的要求，只需要一丁点这种稀缺但强效的香料。旅行者在寻找白天的开胃酒、夜晚的醒酒酒，甚至是药用的胃舒缓剂时，总会津津有味地喝上一大杯这种营养丰富的牛奶。",
	"Neverwinter nectar is an expensive but tasty spirit-based drink, known for its sweet fruit-infused flavor, buttery base, and citrus-tinged aftertaste. Perennially popular in Neverwinter, this \"nectar\" has gradually appeared on the drink lists of many of the finer eateries among the well-traveled cities of the Sword Coast. The surprisingly crisp and refreshing cocktail is so rich in flavor, it is often consumed in lieu of dessert or as an accompaniment to lighter fare. Veteran barkeeps unlock the full spectrum of flavors when they combine the unique mixture of juices, brandy, and white wine with a touch of sparkling water and ice. Felzoun's Folly, in Waterdeep, serves one of the more notable iterations of this syrupy and perfectly divine concoction.": "永冬花蜜是一种昂贵但美味的烈酒，以其甜美的水果风味、黄油基底和柑橘的回味而闻名。这种 \"花蜜 \"在永冬常年流行，并逐渐出现在剑海岸旅行城市中许多高级餐厅的酒水单上。这种令人惊讶的鸡尾酒清脆爽口，风味浓郁，经常被用来代替甜点或作为清淡菜肴的佐餐酒。资深酒吧老板将果汁、白兰地和白葡萄酒的独特混合物与淡淡的气泡水和冰块调和在一起，就能释放出各种风味。位于水底城的 Felzoun's Folly 就是这种糖浆味完美调制酒的代表之一。",
	"As most adventurers know, there are serious spirits, hard liquors, and courage-enhancing brews that serve to bolster one's resolve before a trip down the well into the Undermountain. The drink known as butternut beer is none of these things. Instead, it is a sweetened and mirthful beverage best served as a dessert for a hearty meal or after a long day's night exploring Halaster's lair. Although it packs enough bourbon and butterscotch schnapps to rattle the senses, it is not intended to impair judgment. Rather, it's meant to encourage a hearty belly laugh and dull the aches of an adventurer's knotted muscles.": "大多数冒险者都知道，在下井进入地下深山之前，有一些烈酒、烈性酒和能增强勇气的啤酒可以增强人的意志。而这种被称为 \"奶油啤酒 \"的饮料却不是这些东西。相反，它是一种甜美欢快的饮料，最适合作为丰盛大餐后的甜点，或者在探索哈拉斯特巢穴一天一夜之后饮用。虽然它含有足够的波旁酒和奶油薄荷酒来刺激人们的感官，但它并不打算影响人们的判断力。相反，它能让人开怀大笑，缓解冒险者肌肉紧绷的疼痛。",

	"So, the oddest event has befallen us.": "于是，最奇怪的事情发生了。",
	"Some hours after we fled the Yawning Portal—cause of an unpaid bill—we found sanctuary in the underhold of a sea vessel docked at port. As I calmed my stalwart party, a door creaked aside, and framed in dim light came to us a small, curious figure—no taller than my brother, had I one. Encased head to toe in dented bronze plate, squat and pot-bellied, this ancient lad called out in a fluty gasp.": "在我们逃离 \"打哈欠之门 \"几个小时后--因为一笔未付的账单--我们在一艘停靠在港口的海船的底舱里找到了避难所。就在我安抚我的伙伴们的时候，一扇门吱嘎吱嘎地响了起来，昏暗的灯光下，一个小巧而好奇的身影向我们走来。这个古老的小伙子从头到脚都穿着凹陷的青铜板，蹲在地上，大腹便便，气喘吁吁地叫着。",

And with a mighty groan, our vessel set sail.": "就在这时，布里安让我大吃一惊，他从圣衣的暗袋里拿出了红宝石--我的宝贝红宝石！就这样把它交给了丁特，丁特的反应是把红宝石整个吞了下去！没有！丁特的眼圈瞬间红了，然后他转身离开了观....。伴随着一声有力的呻吟，我们的船起航了。",

Whether by magic or mischief, these noodles are sure to satisfy even the most space-weary explorers.": "虽然被称为酒馆面条的美味佳肴在整个多元宇宙中都很常见，但布拉尔岩石上的各种酒馆所提供的酒馆面条才是真正的人间美味。据传，面条本身是布拉尔湖深处鲶鱼的口腔触须。事实真相无从考证。不那么神秘的是这道菜有多美味，尤其是蘸上迷迭香、大蒜、洋葱和白葡萄酒调制的清淡酱汁时，就像布拉尔高城岩石上的 Mano-War 餐厅所做的那样。无论是魔法还是恶作剧，这些面条一定能满足最厌倦太空的探险者的需求。",
	"For those seeking sugary baubles to brighten the palate, do not neglect the sour yet sweet tamarind balls that festoon the market stalls of Trademeet and the areas surrounding Firedrake Bay in the lands of Faerûn. From Amn to Calimshan to Tashalar, these tasty morsels made of tamarind pulp and dates are a much beloved dessert and trail-side snack. Some of the finest examples exist a few miles to the south of Trademeet in Mosstone, at the venerable Drover's Last Drink, where they add a bit of vanilla and large-crystal sugar to the mix.

	"Predating even the most rustic plates, trencher bread served as a functional, and edible, tool for serving food. Usually allowed to harden and become stale, this flat, round loaf can not only hold the meal but also become the next course once the edible \"plate\" has absorbed any juices or sauce and softened. Even when civilization along the Sword Coast advanced, the pre-Netherese tradition of serving food on edible plates remained. No longer used for pure utility, trencher bread is traditionally prepared hard, flat, and dry, but it is lightly salted and seasoned to make the \"second course\" more appealing. It has also taken on other shapes, notably a bowl, which has become a popular vessel for serving soups and stews. The bread is served along the crowded, cobbled lanes of major metropolises as far south as Calimport and as distant as the Rock of Bral asteroid spaceport.

	"The bustling pedestrian pathways that etch the Rock of Bral are known for their prodigious offerings of finger foods. One such treat that garners all the accolades from the \"locals\" is a dish called the Tears of Selûne, a spicy, spit-roasted crispy fish, which came into fashion as a quick, crunchy snack that you can eat off a stick. Typically made with a firm white fish, like sea bass, the secret weapon of these delicacies is said to be the seasoning—a tantalizing mix of paprika, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Today, you can sample these crispy treats throughout the Rock of Bral. Some street chefs fry them in a skillet, though connoisseurs insist the open flame yields the best texture. Whichever way you cook them, these fish skewers are best served with a starchy base, such as warm rice, to help all the delectable textures and savory flavors go down just right.": "布拉尔岩石上熙熙攘攘的人行道以其丰富的小吃而闻名。其中一道赢得 \"当地人 \"赞誉的美食叫做 \"塞卢恩之泪\"（Tears of Selûne），这是一种香辣的吐口烤脆皮鱼，作为一种可以用棍子夹着吃的香脆快餐而风靡一时。据说这些美食的秘密武器是调料--辣椒粉、酱油和芝麻的诱人混合物。如今，您可以在整个布拉尔岩石品尝到这些香脆的美食。有些街头厨师会用平底锅煎炸，但行家们坚持认为明火煎炸的口感最好。无论采用哪种烹饪方式，这些鱼串最好搭配淀粉类食物，例如热米饭，这样可以让所有的美味和口感都恰到好处。",

But the duergar are also renowned craftsmen, and what they do, they do well, which includes cooking a small but reliable menu of staples. And perhaps no duergar food is more prized than their smoked herring. While the original boasts herring from the dangerous depths of Darklake, known for imbuing the fish with distinctive brine and mineral flavorings, this version utilizes herring sourced from bountiful Lake Bral, a vital repository of water located in the center of this well-populated asteroid. There is no denying that a proper subterranean brine takes especially well to heat from Underdark fire lichen, but chile peppers will suffice for those chefs cooking on the surface.

	"It is said, \"When in space, do as spacefarers do,\" and this can prove useful advice when talking about food. One will never know how, or why, pork became such a readily available source of protein on the Rock of Bral, but that mystery is beside the point when a steaming bowl of spiced pork and orange peppers is on offer. In truth, the underside of the one-mile-long ovaloid asteroid, founded by humanoid Captain Bral, serves as a sustainable and farmable ecosystem capable of oxygen production. It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost. When ordered \"the Captain's way,\" the explosion of spices (paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic, fennel, cumin, and some mystery space seed grown onsite) combined with the zest of the orange peppers is like a peg-legged dohwar kick straight to the taste buds.": "俗话说：\"在太空中，要像太空宇航员那样做。\"这句话在谈论食物的时候很有用。人们永远不会知道猪肉是如何或为什么成为布拉尔岩石上如此容易获得的蛋白质来源的，但当一碗热气腾腾的香猪肉和橙色辣椒端上桌时，这个谜就不重要了。事实上，这颗一英里长的椭圆形小行星由人形的布拉尔船长创建，其底部是一个可持续发展的、可耕种的生态系统，能够生产氧气。这里甚至还有一个淡水湖（布拉尔湖），经常由从冰小行星上采集的水补给。香料猪肉和橘子胡椒是著名的布拉尔船长的最爱，也一直是由好客的大块头路易吉经营的 \"笑看客 \"餐厅和其他点缀在这个无法无天的小行星前哨站大道上的明显不雅食肆的招牌菜。 以 \"船长的方式 \"点菜时，各种香料（辣椒粉、香菜、卡宴辣椒、大蒜、茴香、小茴香和一些现场种植的神秘太空种子）与橙色辣椒的果皮结合在一起，就像一脚踢在味蕾上。",

Guardians of the deep, commonly clustered around ocean trenches and far from the eyes and reach of humankind, triton have increasingly emerged from self-imposed isolation to cohabit with the other peoples of the multiverse. A satisfying synthesis of tastes that borrows more from the surface world than from the seafloor, steak of the deep features a thick slab of braised swordfish, topped with a simmered tomato-based blend of onion, garlic, paprika, and a crisp dry sherry, yielding a fragrant and filling main course.

Or would you kindly settle for a warm, tasty plate of silver, instead?\" Both the dish and tradition have somehow found their way to Krynn, even though Stargath House is nowhere to be found on the planet.": "在法鲁尼亚的阿姆（Amn）大陆上，有一家名为斯塔加斯屋（Stargath House）的迷人而设施齐全的旅店，它以一道名为 \"银盘\"（Plate of Silver）的招牌烤土豆和鳀鱼菜肴而闻名。这道菜被命名为 \"银盘\"，是为了安慰和警告那些想通过寻找传说中的宝藏来满足口腹之欲的人。据说，宝藏中的黄金会在胸口的（%0%）板中发出响声，试图夺走闯入者的生命。许多客人都曾不听彬彬有礼的服务员的谆谆教导而失踪。 按照传统，当这道独特的美食上桌时，斯塔加斯宅邸的员工和常客们会把金币放在不倒翁里摇晃，以此让接受斯塔加斯款待的人做出选择：\"你是愿意冒着冰冷刺骨的死亡风险来换取闹鬼的黄金承诺呢？还是你愿意用一盘温暖可口的银器来代替？\" 这道菜和这一传统都以某种方式传到了克莱恩，尽管在这个星球上找不到星际之家。",
	"Those who happen upon the Solamnian city of Palanthus would be fools not to drop by the A Taste of Silvanost restaurant and try its famous Stuffed Trout. Of course, what the trout is stuffed with is anyone's guess. According to the menu (which is written in Silvanesti), you'll find \"specially prepared mixtures\" inside. But rumor has it the stuffing is composed of breadcrumbs made from the fresh-baked loaves of the elven proprietor Solamna Farseer, and seasoned with a rare spice known as Old Bay, named for the Bay of Branchala, next to which the city rests.": "来到索兰尼亚城市帕兰瑟斯的人，如果不去 \"希尔瓦诺斯特之味 \"餐厅品尝一下著名的酿鳟鱼，那就太傻了。当然，鳟鱼的馅是什么谁也说不准。根据菜单（用希瓦内斯提语书写），您会发现里面有 \"特别准备的混合物\"。但有传言说，馅料是由精灵老板索拉姆娜-法赛尔（Solamna Farseer）新鲜出炉的面包屑做成的，并用一种名为 \"老海湾\"（Old Bay）的稀有香料调味。",
	"Kender loaf, or raston pastry as it has been called, is a filling, raisin-specked dessert to round out a hearty meal. However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today.": "坎德人面包，或称拉斯顿糕点，是一种馅料丰富、葡萄干点缀的甜点，为丰盛的晚餐锦上添花。然而，拉斯顿糕点的早期形态可以追溯到第一次龙族战争时期，当时连过期面包屑都不能丢弃。人们习惯把过期面包的面包皮扔进盆里，然后捣碎制成牲畜饲料，但坎德人看到了商机。过期的面包被从其他半成品中分离出来，浸泡在水中，加糖、加香料和烘干，然后制成所谓的 \"坎德人面包\"（kender loaf），也就是人们常说的 \"二手面包\"。坎德人面包如此受欢迎，以至于在制作过程中加入了鸡蛋、奶油和香料，演变成了我们今天所知的面包布丁。",
	"Nothing warms the soul quite like the scent of a freshly baked kender cobbler. The flavor of this effervescent blend of peaches, dark berries, vanilla, cloves, and liquor (for the brave, a sizable enough dash to make your toes tingle) is as fascinating as the diminutive folk who invented it. Kender—said to be birthed of magic and chaos—approach food in much the same manner as they traverse the worlds of the multiverse: adventurously. The buttery, flaky topping oozing with soft, chopped peaches should be enough, but when combined with blueberries, the cobbler filling brightens in a curiously kender way. This dessert is especially popular on Mid-year Day in Sixthmonth, which also happens to be Peach Month in Ansalon, but it remains the dessert of choice for the kender of Krynn regardless of holiday or season. Often served as a cobbler, sometimes as a crumble, but never to be skipped, especially when offered warm with a hefty dollop of fresh whipped cream.": "没有什么比新鲜出炉的坎德人馅饼的香味更能温暖人心了。这种混合了桃子、黑浆果、香草、丁香和烈酒（对于勇敢的人来说，少许的烈酒足以让你的脚趾发麻）的泡腾片的味道就像发明它的矮小的人一样迷人。坎德人--据说是魔法和混沌的产物--对待食物的方式就像他们穿越多元宇宙一样：冒险。黄油、薄片状的表层渗出柔软的桃子碎，这就足够了，但如果再加上蓝莓，馅料就会以一种奇特的坎德人方式变得鲜亮起来。这道甜点在第六月的年中节特别受欢迎，而这一天恰好也是安萨隆的桃子月，但无论在哪个节日或季节，它都是克莱恩坎德人的首选甜点。它通常以馅饼的形式出现，有时也以面包屑的形式出现，但绝对不会被省略，尤其是在热食时加上一大勺新鲜的鲜奶油。",
	"The golden rule with any good tavern punch is that, when going down, it should feel like you were struck by a physical one and make you more inclined to throw one. Such is the case with the potent potable sometimes called Irlymeyer's Dragonfire Punch. A creation of the mysterious mixologist for whom the drink is named, and perfected by Otik Sandath of the Inn of the Last Home, this refreshing beverage is chock-full of domestic and imported juices from across Krynn, including cranberry, orange, and pineapple. The \"punch\" comes from the generous amounts of brandy and sparkling wine. Originally named for its use of poisonous dragon's rose blossoms, the recipe has changed significantly over the years, but its effect upon patrons has not.": "酒馆里任何好酒的金科玉律都是，下酒时要让人感觉像被实物击中一样，让人更想喝上一杯。有时被称为伊利迈耶龙火潘趣酒的烈性烈酒就是如此。这种清爽的饮料由神秘的调酒师创造，并由最后家园客栈的奥蒂克-桑达斯完善，其中富含来自克莱恩各地的国产和进口果汁，包括蔓越莓、橙子和菠萝。大量白兰地和气泡酒则为这种饮料增添了 \"活力\"。这种饮料最初因使用有毒的龙蔷薇花而得名，多年来配方发生了很大变化，但对顾客的影响却没有改变。",
	"Purists drink mead straight, savoring the often complex flavor of the honey, which varies with the different bees and flowers they work. The traditional mead made in Morning Dew, near the Plains of Dust, in Krynn, has its advocates. But why not spice it up in the style of adventurer and former mixologist at the famous Inn of the Last Home Tika Waylan? A much tangier, more citrus-forward concoction, Tika's mead balances the sweetness of the honey syrup and the bottled mead with a more pure alcohol. The combination is chilled with ice and served cool. Be careful, though. If you're used to a mild mead, you'll find that Tika's version packs quite a bit more punch.": "纯粹主义者直接饮用蜂蜜酒，细细品味蜂蜜复杂的味道，这种味道因蜜蜂和花朵的不同而不同。克莱恩尘埃平原附近的晨露镇酿制的传统蜂蜜酒有其拥护者。但为什么不按照冒险家、著名的最后家园客栈前调酒师提卡-韦兰的风格来调制呢？蒂卡的蜂蜜酒口味更浓郁，柑橘味更重，用更纯净的酒精平衡了蜂蜜糖浆和瓶装蜂蜜酒的甜味。这两种酒都要加冰冰镇。不过要小心。如果你习惯了温和的蜂蜜酒，你会发现蒂卡的版本更有冲击力。",

The city's proximity to forests, rich farmland, and the sea made it an obvious destination for chefs and diners from across the Realms. And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining.

Named after the arcane incantation known for blasting its target with a rush of frigid energy and slowing their steps, ray of frost provides a cool option at upmarket taverns with more extensive and adventurous drink lists.

	"Ruby cordial is traditionally a saccharine swill of liquefied dark cherries blended into a fortified wine from the southern Moonshae Islands, where the aperitif first originated. While any cherries will do, the cherries of choice originate from the same rustic archipelago where they ripen in the sandy island soil, which imbues them with a sweet, robust flavor. Distilling cherry stems, skins, and even pits into the liqueur activates an almost nutty layer of flavor that hits right after the initial sugary wave passes. The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices. Even better, the Blade serves food and drink right in the guest rooms, ensuring that no one will notice just how many of these wondrous cocktails are consumed.": "红宝石鸡尾酒传统上是一种糖精泔水，由液化的黑樱桃与强化酒混合而成，这种酒产自这种开胃酒的发源地月岛南部。虽然任何樱桃都可以，但我们选择的樱桃产自同一个质朴的群岛，它们在岛上的沙质土壤中成熟，赋予了它们甜美、浓郁的风味。在利口酒中加入樱桃梗、果皮甚至果核，可以在最初的糖味过后立即产生一层近乎坚果的风味。刀锋与星辰 \"是博德之门港口城市一家久经考验的酒馆，它用传统的红宝石波特酒代替发酵的月海樱桃汁，对这种近海主食进行了出色的诠释。更妙的是，\"刀锋 \"餐厅就在客房里提供食物和饮料，确保没有人会注意到这些奇妙的鸡尾酒被喝掉了多少。",

These allium-based pancakes are an inexpensive and unexpectedly filling treat that pairs easily with savory roast meats.

Whichever protein you cook, it is sure to reanimate your taste buds.": "双兔旅馆位于僵尸横行的巴罗维亚苏兰吉岛上，其招牌菜是用当地的一种名酒炖兔肉，这应该不足为奇。更令人吃惊的是这道菜的制作者，因为据说这位老板兼主厨即使死了也 \"才华不减当年\"。这是一个典型的例子，人们不想知道香肠是如何制作的，或者在这种情况下，不想知道炖肉是如何制作的--这是一种充满百里香、牛至和干白葡萄酒复杂香味的美味杂烩。在没有兔肉的地区，鸡肉已成为一种流行的（在许多情况下是首选的）替代品。无论您烹饪哪种蛋白质，都一定能重新激活您的味蕾。",
	"Whole roast boar, or some parts thereof, is a favorite at the banquets of vampire hosts throughout the Domains of Dread. It is rumored that hosts wait until their guests are \"glassy of eye, greasy of chin, and a drowsy cheer has come upon them\" to insert a single fang to the jugular of each guest and exsanguinate to their taste. Proper preparation requires of the cook an unabashed love of jam, port, and brown sugar, applied with a heavy hand to flavor the meat, ensuring that you and your guests will leave nothing on your plates. For those lucky travelers fortunate enough to escape the fog-shrouded confines of Barovia to Toril, a variation of this hearty and succulent feast is a specialty of the Boar with Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold, which sometimes uses pork when a boar cannot be procured and is often served with a dry ruby wine from Cormyr.": "整只烤野猪或其中的某些部分，是恐惧之域各地吸血鬼主人宴会上的最爱。据传，主人会等到客人们 \"两眼无神、下巴油腻、昏昏欲睡 \"时，才会把一根獠牙插入每位客人的颈部，让他们尽情地放血。正确的烹饪方法要求厨师对果酱、波特酒和红糖毫不掩饰地热爱，并用重手为肉类调味，确保您和您的客人不会在盘子里留下任何东西。对于那些有幸逃离浓雾笼罩的巴洛维亚来到托瑞尔的幸运旅行者来说，这种丰盛多汁的盛宴是诺亚纳尔堡的黑獠牙野猪肉的变体，在买不到野猪肉的情况下，有时会使用猪肉，通常会配上来自科米尔的干红葡萄酒。",
	"Quij's Plate, consisting of pan-fried sausage, twice-browned potatoes, and eggs, is a filling meal that infallibly populates the menus of countless caravan cooks. Easy to prepare on the road for large parties, it has also become a popular dish in the military for its simplicity and heartiness to help soldiers brave the endless grey days. Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter. The unusual name has since become the catch-all term for the countless iterations of this sausage-and-potato-based campfire classic, including those that migrated to misty Barovia via lost and hungry adventurers.": "由煎香肠、煎过两次的土豆和鸡蛋组成的 \"Quij 之盘\"，是无数商队厨师菜单上的必备菜肴。这道菜易于在旅途中为大型聚会准备，也因其简单丰盛而成为军队中的流行菜肴，帮助士兵们勇敢地度过无尽的灰暗日子。Quij's Plate 的名字来源于罗比拉尔领主的一名兽人随从，他别出心裁地用盾牌当平底锅，为他的冒险队伍烹制了这道香肠大餐。从那时起，这个不寻常的名字就成了以香肠和土豆为基础的篝火经典菜肴的总称，包括那些通过迷路和饥饿的冒险者迁移到迷雾巴洛维亚的菜肴。",
	"Fig cakes are an easily preserved pouch snack for explorers with a sweet tooth. A perfect fig cake is as much about the fig as it is about the lightly toasted and ground almonds that form this fruity confection's chewy base. While honeyed fig tarts were extremely popular in Calimshan on the planet Toril, it is believed that this unique dessert originally hailed from the desolate wastes of the Shadowfell. Developed by the elves native to the Plane of Shadow called the Shadar-Kai, these treats are sweet enough to be at home even in the dreamy Feywild. In addition to the sesame seeds and anise seeds, a strong brandy is often infused into the mix, to both sweeten and fortify these small pressed cakes. While fig cakes do not come cheap, they are, nonetheless, a proud (and delicious) reminder of the resourcefulness of the Shadar-Kai.": "对于喜欢甜食的探险家来说，无花果蛋糕是一种易于保存的袋装零食。一块完美的无花果蛋糕既要有无花果的香味，也要有杏仁的嚼劲。虽然蜂蜜无花果馅饼在托瑞尔星球的卡里姆山非常流行，但人们相信这种独特的甜点最初是来自荒凉的暗影荒原。这种甜点由阴影界的精灵--沙达凯人研制而成，即使在梦幻的仙境中也甜美无比。除了芝麻和茴香籽，无花果饼中还经常加入浓烈的白兰地，既能增加甜味，又能强化这些小压制饼的口感。虽然无花果饼的价格并不便宜，但它们却是沙达尔-凯人引以为豪（和美味）的足智多谋的象征。",
	"Frequently enjoyed by the Shadovar as a nightcap or a light dessert, honey milk is traditionally a stand-alone beverage that can be served chilled, warm, or even as toddy, spiked with herbal liqueur (as it is frequently done in the Shadowfell's forsaken city of Gloomwrought). While the preparation of honey milk is quite simple, the best versions balance a modest amount of honey with the freshest dairy (often imported from the Prime Material Plane) to produce a hearty yet refreshing drink served to all ages. However, the true key to properly preparing honey milk is patience. Traditionally, shadovar alchemists allow the mixture to marinate and cool for several hours before serving, and often include a garnish of cinnamon or citrus to make an attractive presentation for this lovely libation. Its elixir-like qualities are whispered to be good on the gut.": "传统上，蜂蜜牛奶是一种独立的饮料，沙多瓦人经常将其作为睡前酒或清淡的甜点来享用，它可以冰镇、温热，甚至可以作为加了草药利口酒的奶茶饮用（在暗影陨落的遗弃之城 Gloomwrought 就经常这样做）。蜂蜜牛奶的制作非常简单，最好的蜂蜜牛奶会在适量的蜂蜜和最新鲜的奶制品（通常从主物质位面进口）之间取得平衡，从而制作出一种老少皆宜、丰盛而又清爽的饮品。然而，正确制作蜂蜜牛奶的真正关键在于耐心。传统上，Shadovar 炼金术士会让混合物腌制和冷却数小时后再饮用，通常还会用肉桂或柑橘做点缀，使这种可爱的饮料呈现出诱人的效果。据说，这种酒具有灵丹妙药般的功效，对肠胃很有好处。",
	"Barovia is known for many things, its wine among them. The Wizard of Wines Vineyard is legendary for producing some of the finest wines throughout the planes and multiverse, such as the full-bodied Red Dragon Crush and the crisp Champagne du le Stomp. But not all wines that emerge from the mists of Barovia are of equal quality, as evidenced by the existence of Purple Grapemash No. 3. Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable. However, in some areas of the Shadowfell, clever mixologists have added copious amounts of ice and lime juice to the pungent grape-ish mix, turning this otherwise mediocre concoction into a refreshing, slushy treat worth at least four copper pieces anywhere.": "巴罗维亚有许多闻名遐迩的事物，其中就包括葡萄酒。葡萄酒巫师酒庄因酿造出整个位面和多元宇宙中最优质的葡萄酒而闻名于世，例如醇厚的红龙压碎酒和清冽的跺脚香槟酒。但并不是所有从巴洛维亚的迷雾中走出的葡萄酒都具有同样的品质，3 号紫葡萄酒就是最好的证明。在大多数当地酒馆和其他恐惧之域，这种佐餐酒的价格仅为每品脱三个铜币，因此并不出众。然而，在暗影之城的某些地区，聪明的调酒师们在刺鼻的葡萄味混合物中加入了大量的冰块和酸橙汁，将这种原本平庸的调制酒变成了清爽的雪泥，在任何地方都至少值四个铜币。",

However, this recipe from Fortune's Wheel yields a moist and chewy loaf that is bound to become a mealtime staple on any dinner table. Different types of beer yield distinctive flavors of bread and, depending on the varietal, it may even add leavening to the baking process, changing the ultimate density of the loaf. But regardless of the beer you choose (the Fortune's Wheel uses a dark, dry stout), it's all about the quality of the batter.": "多元宇宙中的许多食肆都声称自己拥有最好的啤酒面包配方，但西格尔贵族夫人区的高档食堂 \"财富之轮 \"确实拥有。任何在面团中加入啤酒的面包都被认为是啤酒面包，其效果通常与普通啤酒一样一般。不过，《财富之轮》中的这道菜却能做出湿润而有嚼劲的面包，必将成为任何餐桌上的主食。不同类型的啤酒会产生不同风味的面包，根据啤酒品种的不同，它甚至会在烘焙过程中添加发酵剂，从而改变面包的最终密度。不过，无论您选择哪种啤酒（\"财富之轮 \"使用的是黑啤），最重要的还是面糊的质量。",
	"Sigil's lively marketplaces are brimming with strange, fresh meats and fish imported from across the greater multiverse. These expansive emporiums are an overwhelming explosion of scents, textures, colors, and flavors, not only making them a chef's dream but a breeding ground for new culinary ideas. Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels is one such intrinsically Sigil meal on offer in many of the city's six wards. While the combination of pork and mollusk might seem unusual, this atypical culinary marriage is what makes the meal uniquely Sigil. An inspired combination of surf and turf, this dish has made its way across the multiverse as far as the Cutlass of Luskan on Toril, where fresh mussels are harvested in droves from the Sea of Swords, while the cured bacon is brought in almost daily from Mirabar via the River Mirar.": "西格尔热闹非凡的集市上到处都是从大千世界进口的新鲜肉类和鱼类。这些广阔的集市充斥着各种气味、质地、颜色和味道，不仅是厨师的梦想，也是新烹饪理念的温床。培根裹熏青口贝就是西格尔城六区许多地方都有的一道美食。虽然猪肉和软体动物的结合似乎并不寻常，但这种非典型的烹饪组合却让这道菜成为西吉尔的独特之处。这道菜是冲浪和草皮的灵感结合，它的足迹遍布多元宇宙，远至托瑞尔（Toril）的路斯坎刀（Cutlass of Luskan），那里的新鲜贻贝成群结队地从剑之海（Sea of Swords）捕捞而来，而腌熏肉则几乎每天都从米拉巴（Mirabar）经米拉尔河（River Mirar）运来。",
	"Serving equally well as a solo course or as a starter paired with a lighter main, Chickpea and Spicy Sausage Soup is a hearty, delicious, protein-filled potage. As served in Sigil, this soup incorporates Sweet Larissa's sausages, imported from Plague-Mort—the less you know about how she makes them the better. But one thing you will know is she makes them hot: with the sort of spices mortals should avoid unless in ethereal form. The chickpeas offer a starchy and earthy sanctuary from the oily, spicy sausage and red pepper flakes, all of it swimming in a garlicky chicken broth, flavored with tomato. Common variations on this dish introduce tarragon for a pungent and inspired twist on the classic. Although widely available, and often considered a meal for the masses, this is nonetheless a delectable soup that has rightfully earned its place in the heart of many citizens of the greater multiverse.": "鹰嘴豆辣香肠汤既可以单独食用，也可以作为开胃菜搭配清淡的主食，是一道丰盛、美味、充满蛋白质的炖汤。在西格尔（Sigil），这道汤加入了从瘟疫地狱（Plague-Mort）进口的甜拉里萨香肠，您对她的制作方法了解得越少越好。但有一点你一定会知道，那就是她做的香肠是热的：用的是凡人应该避免的香料，除非是虚无缥缈的香料。鹰嘴豆为油腻、辛辣的香肠和红辣椒片提供了淀粉和泥土的庇护，所有这些都浸泡在带蒜味的鸡汤中，并加入番茄调味。这道菜的常见变体引入了龙蒿，为经典菜肴增添了辛辣和灵感。虽然这道菜很容易买到，而且经常被认为是大众菜肴，但它却是一道美味的汤，理所当然地赢得了大宇宙中许多公民的喜爱。",
	"While Sigil's Great Bazaar is perhaps the most famous market in the known multiverse—a vibrant conflux of cultures and cuisines—this self-proclaimed \"city at the center of the multiverse\" also boasts countless storefronts and street bazaars, offering equally rare and exciting gastronomy. Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish is one such inexpensive delicacy, readily acquired in the Lower Ward or the more destitute Hive Ward. As quick to fry as it is to consume, this chili-and-cayenne-tinged, batter-fried white fish is a feast for the taste buds. Best served sizzling-hot, straight from the pan, wrapped in locally cultivated lettuce or a flatbread for easy ingestion en route to the next plane.": "西格尔的大集市可能是已知多元宇宙中最著名的集市--一个充满活力的文化和美食的汇集地--这个自称为 \"多元宇宙中心的城市 \"还拥有无数的店面和街头集市，提供同样稀有和令人兴奋的美食。火裹金鱼就是这样一种物美价廉的美食，在下城区或更贫困的蜂巢区很容易买到。这种带有辣椒和卡宴辣椒味的面糊油炸白鱼不仅煎得快，而且吃得也快，是味蕾的盛宴。出锅后最好直接裹上当地种植的生菜或扁面包，热气腾腾地食用，方便在下一班飞机上食用。",
	"It is fact that the only way in or out of Sigil is through one of the city's innumerable portals. It is also fact that while in Sigil, one must try the famous Emerald Chicken. Gifted its name from the splash of chopped greens, intermingled with chunks of fowl, chicken livers, onions, and a strong dash of incendiary spices, Emerald Chicken demands an adventurous palate—it was originally made for tieflings with fiendspices—and a cool glass of ale to quench the burn. A milder version became famous in far-off Purskul, on Toril, in eateries such as the Owlroost Head.": "事实上，进出西吉尔城的唯一通道就是这座城市数不胜数的传送门之一。在西格尔城，人们必须品尝著名的翡翠鸡，这也是不争的事实。翡翠鸡之所以得名，是因为鸡肉中夹杂着切碎的蔬菜、大块的鸡肉、鸡肝、洋葱和浓烈的香料。翡翠鸡需要冒险家的味觉--这道菜最初是为带有恶魔香料的铁匠做的，还需要一杯清凉的麦酒来解酒。在遥远的托瑞尔（Toril）的普斯库尔（Purskul），\"猫头鹰之头\"（Owlroost Head）等餐馆里，一种口味较淡的鸡肉非常有名。",
	"If you intend to police the chaotic streets of Sigil, it's best not to do it on an empty stomach. The warriors of the Harmonium are deeply dedicated to keeping order but are perhaps not so adventuresome in their tastes, so this rich, filling meal-in-itself will keep a soldier on the march for hours on end. Heaps of it are hot and plentiful in their barracks in the Lady's Ward. To maximize its proteins, this dish includes not just lamb but a medley of meats, which gives it its distinctive, hearty flavor. Ironically, a certain quantity of this meatloaf somehow finds its way into the hands of street vendors—this is, after all, a town where everyone finds a way to turn a quick profit.": "如果您打算在西格尔混乱的街道上维持治安，最好不要空腹行动。Harmonium 的战士们全心全意地维护秩序，但他们的口味可能并不那么冒险，因此这种丰富而饱腹的食物本身就能让战士们连续行军数小时。在他们位于夫人病房的营房里，热气腾腾的饭菜堆积如山。为了最大限度地利用蛋白质，这道菜不仅包括羊肉，还包括多种肉类，从而使其具有独特而丰盛的风味。具有讽刺意味的是，一定数量的肉卷不知何故落入了街头小贩的手中--毕竟，这是一个人人都想方设法赚快钱的小镇。",
	"No matter what you order at Chirper's in the Market Ward of Sigil—from the Niflheim stag ribs to the slaad legs—the sugar biscuits are a complimentary finale. Whether you came for the dancing, the Seawind theater, an art exhibition, or just a quick visit to gawk at the Skull Museum, it is always worth grabbing a bite at Chirper's for the dessert alone. Acquiring the Bytopian chestnuts required to make the puffy dough might require planar travel, but primes can approximate the right taste by adding some cinnamon and cardamom to the mix. Best served with honey as a dip for an extra dash of decadence.": "无论您在西格尔市场区的 Chirper's 点什么菜--从尼弗海姆雄鹿排骨到 slaad 腿--糖饼干都是免费的压轴菜。无论您是为舞蹈、海风剧场、艺术展览而来，还是只是匆匆参观骷髅头博物馆，光是甜点就值得您在奇葩餐厅大快朵颐一番。制作膨松面团所需的拜托利亚栗子可能需要进行平面旅行，但原始人可以在其中加入一些肉桂和豆蔻，以接近正确的口味。食用时最好蘸上蜂蜜，以增加颓废感。",
	"Let it be known, silverfruit, also known as lychee or soapberry, makes for a truly heavenly pie. This medium-size, pink-skinned berry is known for being especially crisp and juicy, with hints of citrus and a floral aroma. But as a pie filling it's surprisingly creamy and custard-like, and it pairs wonderfully with a toasted, flaky crust. The Golden Bariaur Inn (in Sigil's Lady's Ward), which caters to highfalutin clientele from the Upper Planes, serves an astoundingly good slice of this silky dessert. Since Sigil has no natural resources, silverfruit is one of the many uniquely curated imports from the vast array of worlds to which the greater metropolis provides access.": "众所周知，银果又名荔枝或皂荚，是真正的天堂派。这种中等大小、粉红色果皮的浆果以特别脆嫩多汁而闻名，还带有一丝柑橘和花香。但作为馅料，它的奶油和奶油冻的口感却出人意料，配上烤得松软的饼皮，更是绝配。金巴利亚尔客栈（位于西吉尔的夫人病房）专门接待来自上层行星的高级客人，这里的丝滑甜点美味得令人惊叹。由于西格尔没有天然资源，银果是许多独特的舶来品之一，这些舶来品来自大都市所能到达的众多世界。",
	"Kaeth, or coffee, is an aromatic brew made from ground roasted beans and is famous for its invigorating properties, making it a prevalent day starter throughout the worlds of the multiverse. In Sigil, the City of Doors, planar sightseers can sample from a wide array of coffee beans and beverages from countless planets. Kaeth, as it is commonly called on the planet Toril, has developed into quite the delicacy along the Sword Coast, where it is now imported in droves. In the nation of Sembia, a popular method of preparation features a blend of melted chocolate and liquor. In some areas, kaeth is so popular that it has become more profitable than the tea trade. The peoples of the planet Krynn drink tarbean tea and kefre, both of which are derived from vibrant, dark-roasted beans and frequently served black. In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil. Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead.": "咖啡（Kaeth）是一种用磨碎的烘焙咖啡豆制成的芳香饮料，以其提神醒脑的特性而闻名，是多元宇宙世界中最普遍的开胃饮料。在门之城西格尔，星球观光者可以品尝到来自无数星球的各种咖啡豆和饮料。在托瑞尔星球，人们通常称其为 \"Kaeth\"，这种咖啡在剑海岸已经发展成了一种美味佳肴，现在大量进口到这里。在森比亚国，一种流行的制作方法是将融化的巧克力和酒混合在一起。在某些地区，Kaeth 是如此受欢迎，以至于它比茶叶贸易更有利可图。克林星球上的人们饮用焦豆茶和凯福瑞茶，这两种茶都是用充满活力的黑豆烘焙而成，通常是黑茶。与此相反，外星球的居民则饮用大量的香料茶和奶油茶，其中包括著名的天体山陛下茶。 在奥尔斯星球，咖啡的酸性更强，经常被混入奶油酒中，以增加口感。但最著名的可能要数 kav'la，它将奶油椰奶搅入麦芽糖、深色坚果烤肉中，用高大华丽的陶瓷器皿盛装，在西格尔的文化集市上很容易找到。无论您选择哪种口味，Kaeth 都能以各种形式为您提供咖啡因提神剂，无论是在山路上还是在安全的家中。",

	"Elven Flatbread is much more of a delight than its unassuming name suggests. A mosaic of colors and flavors, the thinly sliced vegetables, edible flora, and wild herbs are so elegantly placed atop this chewy focaccia that you almost want to admire it more than eat it. A cornucopia of garden-fresh components frequently make starring appearances—from onions, bell peppers, chives, and cherry tomatoes to sunflowers, elderflowers, squash blossoms, and sprigs of basil. Almost nothing is off-limits when it comes to topping; the only (unspoken) rule is to keep it vibrant and arrange them artfully. Despite elven flatbread being a \"simple\" bread recipe, Feywild eladrin pride themselves on flare and personal presentation. During harvest holidays, each flatbread is presented as a long and ornate loaf that serves as both a centerpiece and a meal starter for dipping in sharp, fragrant olive oils.": "精灵扁面包的美味远不止它那不起眼的名字。切成薄片的蔬菜、食用植物和野菜优雅地摆放在这块富有嚼劲的薄饼上，色香味俱全。从洋葱、甜椒、韭菜、樱桃番茄到向日葵、接骨木花、南瓜花和罗勒花，各种花园里的新鲜食材频频亮相。在配料方面，几乎没有任何禁忌，唯一的（潜规则）就是要保持活力，并巧妙地摆放它们。尽管精灵扁面包是一种 \"简单 \"的面包食谱，但费尔德精灵却为自己的特色和个人风格而自豪。在丰收节期间，每个扁面包都会被摆放成一个长长的华丽面包，既是中心装饰品，也是蘸着香味浓郁的橄榄油的开胃菜。",

This slow-simmered, savory concoction is a delightful mix of potatoes, onions, celery, chives, and ripe herb-infused cream cheese. It is so delightful in fact that it has escaped the mystical confines of the Feywild, making its way within the bustling walls of the Sword Coast port metropolis of Baldur's Gate, to the iconic Elfsong Tavern, where it has become a regional favorite capitalizing on the cornucopia of fresh ingredients on offer. Regardless of where you sample this surprisingly light and tasty soup, the spirit of the Seelie Court original is in every spoonful.": "对于那些有幸与热爱大自然的海利宫廷大主教并肩进餐的冒险者来说，奶酪土豆汤是一道丰盛而不可错过的开胃菜，能让人由内而外地感到温暖。这道慢火煨制的美味佳肴混合了土豆、洋葱、芹菜、韭菜和成熟的香草奶油奶酪。事实上，它是如此美味可口，以至于它逃出了神秘的仙境，来到了繁华的宝剑海岸港口城市博德之门，来到了标志性的精灵之歌酒馆，利用这里丰富的新鲜食材成为了当地人的最爱。无论您在哪里品尝这道令人惊喜的清淡美味汤，每一勺都蕴含着 Seelie Court 原汁原味的精神。",
	"Centuries of deforestation has caused the elves of Elfharrow to get more creative with their diets than those of their forest-based counterparts. Raising livestock has become a way of life for these elves, making dairy a central staple of their foodways.

The key ingredient, though, is a tangy mustard, said to originate in the Feywild, and the dish goes best with a green salad on the side.

A touch of thyme and finely aged balsamic vinegar round out this sweet and acidic treat, so perfectly balanced that even the eladrin of the Feywild often include it as a staple of their elaborate forest feasts. The harengon, rabbit-like denizens of the Feywild, famously prepare this dish with a veritable rainbow of orange, red, white, yellow, and purple carrots, emphasizing presentation as much as flavor.

	"Brackleberry Jam is the Cormyrean moniker for a spread made from a medley of freshly foraged wild berries—one that has earned notoriety throughout the multiverse. While the Cormyr version utilizes strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, and even currants, all iterations of this well-traveled recipe call for fresh blueberries and sugar to properly flavor the mixture. A spritz of lemon and a dash of salt help to not only preserve the mash for canning but brighten the overall experience on the palette. Brackleberry Jam is as common as butter in the forest-heavy country of Cormyr, where its topography and climate yield an abundance of seasonal berries so plentiful they colorfully adorn the region's roads and trails. This jam spreads well on almost any warm loaf or muffin. In the Feywild, the berries are not only more bountiful but also more flavorful, resulting in an exquisite local variety of Brackleberry Jam.": "莓果酱（Brackleberry Jam）是科米尔人对一种用新鲜野生浆果制成的酱料的称呼，这种酱料在整个多元宇宙都享有盛誉。虽然科米尔的版本使用了草莓、覆盆子、黑莓、醋栗甚至醋栗，但这个流传甚广的配方的所有版本都需要新鲜蓝莓和糖来调味。喷洒柠檬汁和少许盐不仅有助于保存罐头用的果泥，还能提亮整个口感。在科米尔这个森林密布的国度，莓果果酱就像黄油一样常见，这里的地形和气候孕育了大量的时令浆果，它们五颜六色地点缀着该地区的道路和小径。这种果酱几乎可以涂抹在任何热面包或松饼上。在费尔德，浆果不仅产量更高，而且味道也更浓郁，因此当地的勃拉克莓果酱也非常精致。",

The nuanced yet indulgent combination of fresh sweet peas, shallots, and feta cheese is a match made in Arvandor, especially once handfuls of the bite-size bounty are dipped in batter and fried to perfection. From Prismeer to Evermeet, elves and those with whom they hold court relish these comforting table treats. Fey Fritters come with a warning: Once you try one, you'll want to spend all day eating these scrumptious snacks...and often, in the Feywild, you just do! It is believed that the recipe originated a millennium ago in the elven enclave of Evermeet, far before it was transported to the Plane of Faerie following the Spellplague. These tasty delicacies have been a mainstay on elven dining tables ever since.": "如果没有一篮子（或三篮子）刚炸好的甜豌豆费伊炸饼，精灵的盛宴就不算完整。新鲜甜豌豆、香葱和羊奶酪的微妙组合让人欲罢不能，在阿凡多是绝配，尤其是当一把把咬一口大小的美食蘸上面糊炸得完美无缺时。从普里斯米尔到埃弗米特，精灵们和他们的宫廷贵族们都非常喜欢这些令人舒心的餐桌美食。费伊炸饼有一个警告： 一旦你尝过一次，你就会想整天都吃这些美味的点心......而且，在费伊王国，你经常会这么做！据说这个配方起源于千年前的精灵飞地 Evermeet，远在法术瘟疫之后被传送到精灵界之前。从那时起，这些美味佳肴就一直是精灵餐桌上的主菜。",
	"A refreshing nonalcoholic aperitif, the drink known as Sprucebark Quaff is famous throughout the multiverse for not only preparing the palate for flavor but also freshening the breath after meals. A simple concoction of clean, fresh water; mint; and sweet cucumber, it is served at upscale taverns, inns, and temples across the Prime Material Plane but is especially popular in the Feywild and upper planes, where a similar mixture forms naturally in many ponds, lakes, and streams. It's believed to have been invented by Faerûnian elves as a method of purifying water, using plants to remove toxins. Whatever its origin, it is sure to recharge trail-weary adventurers no matter what planet or plane they roam.": "云杉皮 Quaff 是一种清爽的无酒精开胃酒，闻名于整个多元宇宙，不仅能让味蕾准备好享受美味，还能在饭后清新口气。这种饮料由干净的清水、薄荷和甜黄瓜简单调制而成，在整个主物质位面的高档酒馆、旅店和寺庙中都有供应，但在费伍德和上层位面尤其流行，因为那里的许多池塘、湖泊和溪流中都会自然形成类似的混合物。据说这是法努精灵发明的一种净水方法，利用植物去除毒素。不管它的来源如何，它一定能让疲惫不堪的冒险者重新振作起来，无论他们在哪个星球或位面漫游。",
	"Despite its promise of a \"banquet,\" the dish known as Eldeen Banquet is actually a hearty, one-dish meal sure to satisfy omnivores as much as vegetarians. Consisting of lightly breaded and fried eggplant topped with a warm, seasoned tomato sauce, this delight hails from the Eldeen Reaches, in the Khorvaire region of Eberron, which is noted for its robust forests and agriculture, and where the dish has occasionally migrated to the Feywild via a secret Fey Crossing. But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views. However, perhaps the best preparation is found in the unassuming Olladra's Arms, in the Hope's Peak district. Here, the portions are as generous as they are flavorful, ensuring the dish truly lives up to its moniker.": "尽管这道菜被称为 \"盛宴\"，但它实际上是一道丰盛的单菜，一定能满足杂食者和素食者的需求。这道美味来自艾伯伦的科尔韦尔（Khorvaire）地区的艾尔丁边缘地带（Eldeen Reaches），那里以茂密的森林和农业著称，这道菜偶尔会通过秘密的费伊通道迁移到费伊荒野。虽然艾尔丁宴被认为是一种地区美食，但在整个沙恩城的知名餐馆中，这种酥脆又松软的茄子馅饼也很常见。位于 Skyway 区的 Azure Gateway 和 Celestial Vista 等高档餐厅提供的 Eldeen Banquet 就像它们的美景一样令人愉悦。不过，在希望之峰区不起眼的奥拉德拉武器店里，也许能找到最好的准备。 这里的菜肴份量充足，味道鲜美，真正做到了名副其实。",

It has even made its way to Evermeet, an elven paradise transported to the Feywild long ago.

Elves store their Elverquisst in crystal decanters capable of absorbing light and showcasing the tantalizing specks of gold dancing about in the rich claret mixture. According to legend, upon whispering a secret Elvish phrase, the sunlight streaming through the bottle will gather into thirteen points, resembling the constellation Correlian.

	"Don't forget that cooking, and eating, can make a mess, but not all dishes are equally messy. Some recipes, such as (%0%), (%1%), and (%2%), don't require players to have their own plates and utensils. But wherever you are bringing the food, have a plan for how to deal with any leftovers, and how not to leave a dish disaster in your wake.": "别忘了，烹饪和进食都会弄得一团糟，但并不是所有的菜肴都一样脏乱。有些菜谱，如 (%0%)、(%1%) 和 (%2%)，不需要玩家自己准备盘子和餐具。但是，无论您把食物带到哪里，都要计划好如何处理剩菜剩饭，以及如何避免留下菜肴灾难。",
	"One fun way to use this cookbook is to try to match the food your group eats with the adventure you are playing. Whatever city of the D&D multiverse your party is visiting, or whichever wilderness you camp in, there are dishes that can put you in your character's shoes. You may not have the appetite to sample everything that the Bureau of Dark Tables eats as they make their way around Realmspace, but you can still make meals the centerpiece of your adventure.": "使用这本烹饪书的一个有趣方法是尝试将您的团队所吃的食物与您正在进行的冒险相匹配。无论你们一行人要去 D&D 多元宇宙中的哪个城市，或者在哪个荒野露营，都会有一些菜肴能让你设身处地地为角色着想。您可能没有足够的胃口品尝 \"黑暗餐桌局 \"在环游 \"王国空间 \"时吃到的所有食物，但您仍然可以让食物成为冒险的核心。",
	"Plan.": "计划。",
	"(%0%) Don't have a Total Planning Katastrophe. Schedule serious meals for the beginning or end of a play session. If you are doing a real marathon and you need to have a full meal in the middle, take a break from the game. Some of the dishes in this cookbook, like (%1%) and (%2%), make for good snacks around the table, but if you're laying out a multi-course cornucopia, you're going to need the table space. As a rule of thumb, if you need to have utensils and plates out to eat, then set the dice and character sheets away until you're done. You don't want to have to fish a (%3%) out of your (%4%).": "(%0%)避免计划全盘失败。在游戏开始或结束时安排正餐。如果您正在进行一场真正的马拉松比赛，中间需要吃一顿饱饭，那就从游戏中休息一下。本食谱中的一些菜肴，如 (%1%) 和 (%2%)，可以作为餐桌上的点心，但如果您要准备多道菜肴，您就需要有足够的餐桌空间了。根据经验，如果您需要准备餐具和盘子来用餐，那么请将骰子和角色表放在一边，直到用餐完毕。你可不想从你的 (%4%) 里捞出 (%3%)。",
	"There's nothing better than taking an hour after a D&D session to decompress with your friends over a refreshing dinner, chatting about the ups and downs of the day. These post-game sessions can actually make a big difference in your campaigns—it helps everyone to get on the same page about game events, and it may even lead to some inspirations for the next session. And if your session runs all night, there are some great breakfast options in this book, like the (%0%).": "没有什么比在一场 D&D 游戏结束后花上一个小时，和朋友们一起吃一顿清爽的晚餐，聊聊一天的起起落落来得更惬意了。这些游戏后会议实际上会给你的活动带来很大的不同--它有助于每个人就游戏事件达成共识，甚至还能为下一次会议带来一些灵感。如果你的游戏进行了一整夜，本书中还有一些不错的早餐选择，比如 (%0%)。",
	"There are a few ways to integrate eating into the play of D&D. If you know in advance that the party is going to attend a banquet in Ravenloft, you can always arrange to have the meal ready for the players to enjoy in real-time as they role play their characters. This requires some coordination, but it can really bring the game world to life, with a little mood lighting, music, and maybe even costumes.": "有几种方法可以将饮食融入 D&D 游戏中。如果您事先知道聚会将参加拉文洛夫特的宴会，您可以安排准备好饭菜，让玩家在扮演角色时实时享用。这需要一定的协调，但它确实能让游戏世界栩栩如生，再配上一点氛围灯光、音乐，甚至是服装。",
	"But if you're going to build a meal into your D&D session, you probably aren't going to be able to make it from scratch during a quick break. Choose dishes where most of the preparatory work can be done before the session starts, where it will only take a few minutes to heat things up and get them on the table. (%0%) and (%1%) are examples of good choices where you can do a lot of the work beforehand and then heat them up at the last minute. You definitely want to avoid trying to make something like (%2%) while you are in the middle of a play session, because if you get distracted and leave it cooking for too long, it could easily burn and the smell of this rare aquatic treat will no doubt linger until next week's session.": "但是，如果您要在 D&D 环节中安排一餐，您可能无法在短暂的休息时间内从头开始制作。在选择菜肴时，大部分准备工作都可以在课程开始前完成，只需几分钟就能加热并端上桌。(%0%)和(%1%)就是很好的选择，您可以事先做很多准备工作，然后在最后一刻加热。您一定要避免在游戏过程中尝试制作像（%2%）这样的东西，因为如果您分心，让它煮太久，很容易就会烧焦，而这种罕见的水产食物的味道无疑会一直萦绕到下周的游戏。",
	"Improvise.": "即兴表演。",
	"(%0%) Every DM knows that sometimes you just have to wing it—rules are guidelines, and to keep up the flow of play you may have to do what seems right rather than leafing through rulebooks. Every chef knows the same rule: You have to work with what you've got, and sometimes that means taking a different path than the printed recipe.": "(%0%)每一个 DM 都知道，有时你必须随机应变--规则就是指南，为了保持游戏的流畅性，你可能不得不做看起来正确的事情，而不是翻阅规则手册。每个厨师都知道同样的规则：你必须根据你所掌握的情况来工作，有时这意味着要走一条与印刷食谱不同的道路。",
	"Most importantly, these recipes are intended to inspire your creativity. It would be impossible to cram the flavors of the multiverse into this cookbook, or a whole series of them—so take the recipes here as examples. Once you have a sense for the palates of the planes, you can use those as building blocks for developing your own recipes in the spirit of these guidelines.": "最重要的是，这些食谱旨在激发您的创造力。我们不可能把多元宇宙的各种风味都塞进这本食谱或整个系列的食谱中，所以请把这里的食谱当作范例。一旦你对各个位面的口味有了一定的了解，你就可以将它们作为基石，按照这些指南的精神来开发自己的食谱。",
	"Once you get the hang of it, you can develop your own recipes. And if you are having trouble deciding between ingredients, remember that you are a D&D player: you can always roll for it! For example, you could assign tofu, chicken, pork, and beef each to a number on a (%0%). Give it a roll, and whatever number lands becomes the accompanying protein for that tasty (%1%). But like any good DM, if the result of the die roll doesn't feel right, don't be afraid to exercise a little \"divine intervention\" and reroll. Sometimes it takes a die roll to tell you what your real preference would be.": "一旦掌握了窍门，你就可以开发自己的配方。如果您在选择食材时遇到困难，请记住您是一个 D&D 玩家：您可以通过掷骰子来决定！例如，你可以给豆腐、鸡肉、猪肉和牛肉各分配一个 (%0%) 的数字。进行掷骰子，无论掷出的数字是多少，都会成为该美味（%1%）的搭配蛋白质。但是，就像所有优秀的 DM 一样，如果掷骰子的结果感觉不对，不要害怕行使一点 \"神的干预\"，重新掷骰子。有时，掷骰子会告诉你你真正的偏好是什么。",
