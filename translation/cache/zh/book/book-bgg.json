My various encounters with Diancastra—who is no less than a daughter of Annam, the All-Father of the giants!—opened my eyes to the glories, the deep magic, and the wisdom of these ancient people.": "这本书代表了我的一段旅程，我很高兴能牵着你的手，带领你沿着这条路走下去。我从未对巨人产生过浓厚的兴趣，尽管我对他们的力量肃然起敬。我与戴安卡斯特拉的各种接触--她不亚于巨人之父安南的女儿！--让我看到了这些古老民族的荣耀、深邃的魔力和智慧。",

	"The saga of the demigod Diancastra is an epic poem treasured by skalds and storytellers among all kinds of giants. The portion of the saga excerpted at the start of this book is among its most popular scenes, describing how Diancastra convinced her father to imbue her with divinity even though her mother was a mortal giant.": "半神戴安卡斯特拉的传奇是一首史诗，被各种巨人中的骷髅和讲故事的人视为珍宝。本书开头摘录的传奇部分是其中最受欢迎的场景之一，描述了戴安卡斯特如何说服她的父亲赋予她神性，尽管她的母亲是一个凡人巨人。",
	"The story is unusual among the sagas of the giants in its description of Annam's deeds \"in time's dawning.\" It boldly claims Annam collected the fragments of the First World—the original world of the Material Plane, created by the primordial dragons Bahamut and Tiamat—and contributed in some way to their transformation into the Material Plane as it exists today with its myriad worlds. Other sagas claim Annam was similarly instrumental in the creation of the Inner Planes, slowly sorting the tumult of the Elemental Chaos until the four Elemental Planes took shape. These sagas explain the giants' close ties to the elemental forces of air, earth, fire, and water by pointing to Annam's early efforts in the Elemental Planes.": "在巨人传奇中，这个故事与众不同，它描述了安南 \"在时间的黎明 \"所做的事情。故事大胆地宣称，安纳姆收集了第一世界的碎片--物质界最初的世界，由原始巨龙巴哈姆特和提亚马特创造--并以某种方式将它们转化成了今天拥有无数世界的物质界。其他一些传奇故事称，安南在内层位面的形成过程中也起到了类似的作用，它慢慢地整理了元素混沌的混乱，直到四个元素位面成形。这些传奇解释了巨人与气、土、火、水等元素力量的紧密联系，指出了安南在元素界的早期努力。",
	"(%0%) also summarizes the central tragedy of giantkind's long history: Annam intended the giants to rule over all the worlds of the Material Plane, but his six sons—the gods Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor—failed to live up to their father's expectations for them. (Diancastra calls her brothers \"boorish and bumbling.\" Notably, Annam does not refute her on that point.) Annam's disappointment in his sons caused him to retreat to a hidden realm within the Outlands, far removed from the Material Plane and the domains of other gods.": "(%0%）也总结了巨人族漫长历史中的核心悲剧： 安纳姆本想让巨人统治物质界的所有世界，但他的六个儿子--斯特朗默斯（Stronmaus）、梅姆诺尔（Memnor）、苏尔特尔（Surtur）、瑟姆（Thrym）、斯科雷乌斯（Skoraeus）和格罗兰托尔（Grolantor）--却辜负了父亲对他们的期望。(黛安卡斯特称她的兄弟们 \"粗野、笨拙\"）。值得注意的是，安南并没有在这一点上反驳她）。安南对儿子们的失望使他退隐到了外域的一个隐秘国度，远离物质界和其他神的领地。",
	"A key moment in (%0%) is Annam's challenge to his daughter. He dismisses her deeds as \"pranks and rebellion\" and defies Diancastra to bring him \"pure perfection,\" some item that for all his craft and skill he is unable to improve. He clearly intends this to be an impossible task.": "%0%）中的一个关键时刻是安南对女儿的挑战。他将女儿的所作所为斥之为 \"恶作剧和叛逆\"，并要求戴安娜卡斯特拉为他带来 \"纯粹的完美\"，即某种他的技艺和技能都无法改进的物品。他显然想把这当作一项不可能完成的任务。",
	"But Diancastra surprises him. Journeying to the outermost reaches of the Elemental Chaos, where unshaped elements form a tumult of matter and energy, she claims a mote of raw chaos and brings it to her father. Annam quickly shapes it, but he is unsatisfied with the result; he shapes it again and again, but—as Diancastra points out—each of his efforts to craft something from the chaos ends up reducing its raw potential into mere actuality.": "但黛安卡斯特却让他大吃一惊。她来到混沌元素的最外围，在那里，未成型的元素形成了物质和能量的混沌。安纳姆很快就把它塑造了出来，但他对结果并不满意；他一次又一次地塑造它，但正如黛安卡斯特指出的那样，他从混沌中创造出的每一次努力，最终都将混沌的原始潜能化为了现实。",
	"The saga makes a point that concerns more than Diancastra's cleverness. In granting his daughter's request for divinity, Annam acknowledges that the same chaotic, changeable potential exists within his sons and their descendants. Ultimately, this acknowledgment holds out the possibility that Annam's faith in his descendants might be restored and the All-Father might one day be drawn from his self-imposed exile. That glimmer of hope, faint as it might be, is a significant motivation for those giants who hope to reclaim their people's ancient glory, and it might account for the saga's popularity among giants of all kinds.": "这个传奇故事告诉我们一个道理，它不仅仅关乎戴安卡斯特拉的聪明才智。安南在答应女儿的神性请求时，也承认了他的儿子们和他们的后代同样具有混乱、多变的潜能。最终，安南对后代的信任有了恢复的可能，有朝一日万物之父也会从自我放逐中被召唤出来。这一线希望虽然微弱，但对于那些希望重拾其民族古老荣耀的巨人来说，却是一个重要的动力，这也是这部传奇故事在各类巨人中广受欢迎的原因。",
	"A good saga, well-told, reveals a great deal about the teller. If you're lucky and self-aware, it can also show you something about yourself. Only rarely does it tell you much worth knowing about its subject among its alliteration and kennings and such. That said, Bigby presented me with several versions of my saga, and I insisted he use this one. The interpretation he presents here is a reasonable one.": "一个好的传奇故事，讲得好的话，可以揭示讲述者的很多东西。如果你运气好，又有自知之明，它还能让你了解自己。只有在很少的情况下，它才会在典故和谚语中告诉你关于它的主题的许多值得了解的东西。尽管如此，比格比还是给我提供了几个版本的传奇故事，我坚持让他用这个版本。他在这里提出的解释是合理的。",
	"The descendants of Annam are the various creatures of the Giant creature type. The precise details of genealogy linking Annam to these Giants are a matter of mythology, and myths vary from world to world and from one teller to another. Most tellings make a distinction between the main families of giants who are descended from the sons of Annam and the various other creatures whose origins are murkier.": "安南的后裔是各种巨人生物。安南与这些巨人之间的确切家谱细节是一个神话问题，而不同世界和不同讲述者的神话都不尽相同。大多数传说都将安南之子的后裔与其他各种起源不明的生物区分开来。",
	"As described in the (%0%), the ordning ranks the six main families of giants. Each family's place in the ordning corresponds to the birth order of the associated son of Annam: Stronmaus, Annam's firstborn, is regarded as the progenitor of storm giants, and Grolantor, progenitor of hill giants, is Annam's youngest son. Thus, the ordning neatly encompasses and arranges (%1%), (%2%), (%3%), (%4%), (%5%), and (%6%) by connecting them to Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor, respectively.": "正如（%0%）中所述，该法令对六大巨人家族进行了排名。每个家族在秩序中的位置都与相关的安南之子的出生顺序相对应： 安纳姆的长子斯特朗默斯被视为风暴巨人的祖先，而山丘巨人的祖先格罗兰托则是安纳姆最小的儿子。因此，通过将 (%1%)、(%2%)、(%3%)、(%4%)、(%5%) 和 (%6%) 分别与斯特朗默斯 (Stronmaus)、梅姆诺尔 (Memnor)、苏尔特尔 (Surtur)、特里姆 (Thrym)、斯科雷乌斯 (Skoraeus) 和格罗兰托尔 (Grolantor) 联系起来，该条例将它们整齐地包含和排列起来。",
	"That neat structure overlooks the daughters of Annam: Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra. Indeed, these goddesses and their worshipers often push against the boundaries of the ordning, both within each kind of giant and in the overall rankings of the giant families. No giants count the goddesses as ancestors, but that helps ensure their popularity extends across giantkind.": "这种整齐划一的结构忽略了安南的女儿们：希雅塔（Hiatea）、雅兰尼斯（Iallanis）和戴安娜卡斯特（Diancastra）。事实上，这些女神和她们的崇拜者经常会突破秩序的界限，无论是在每种巨人中还是在巨人家族的整体排名中都是如此。没有巨人把这些女神当作祖先，但这有助于确保她们在巨人族中的受欢迎程度。",
	"The structure of the ordning also overlooks the (%0%) and their progenitor, Karontor, who is usually described as Grolantor's older twin. Just as Annam banished Karontor from the family of the gods for his part in inciting the fomorians to assault the Feywild, the All-Father also excluded the fomorians from the ordning.": "神令的结构也忽略了（%0%）和他们的祖先卡隆托尔，卡隆托尔通常被描述为格罗兰托尔的孪生哥哥。正如安南因卡隆托尔参与煽动弗莫瑞亚人袭击费奥王国而将其逐出众神大家庭一样，万物之父也将弗莫瑞亚人排除在神令之外。",
	"Once cloud giants, death giants (introduced in (%0%) of this book) technically have the same rank in the ordning as the other descendants of Memnor. However, by turning away from the gods of their ancestors to serve the Raven Queen, they have abdicated their place in the ordning.": "死亡巨人曾是云巨人，严格来说，他们和其他梅姆诺的后裔一样，在神权中拥有相同的地位。然而，由于背弃了祖先的神灵，转而侍奉乌鸦女王，他们放弃了自己在神权中的地位。",

	"\"Giant\" (capitalized) is also the name of the language spoken by most creatures of the Giant type (as well as a few other creatures, such as hags). References to the language throughout this book typically refer to \"the Giant language\" or \"Giant runes,\" so there should be no confusion between the language and the creature type.": "\"巨人\"（大写）也是大多数巨人类型生物（以及少数其他生物，例如女巫）的语言名称。在本书中提到这种语言时，通常是指 \"巨人语 \"或 \"巨人符文\"，因此不应将这种语言与生物类型混淆。",

The conflict is remembered as the Thousand-Year War, though it almost certainly involved long periods of quiet interrupted by battles of intense savagery and widespread destruction. By the end of this conflict, Ostoria was reduced to a shadow of its former glory—and Annam turned his back on his descendants in disappointment.": "经过四千年的共存和间歇性冲突之后，一条名叫加里克斯的强大红龙--有时被视为龙中之神--引发了龙族与奥斯托利亚巨人的战争。这场冲突被人们称为千年战争，不过几乎可以肯定的是，战争期间有很长一段时间是平静的，中间被激烈的野蛮战斗和大范围的破坏所打断。冲突结束后，奥斯托利亚昔日的辉煌荡然无存，安南失望地离开了他的后裔。",
	"For nearly thirty thousand years since the fall of Ostoria, giants have largely lived in seclusion, keeping as far as possible from the spread of smaller peoples' settlements. From time to time, giants lent their strength to conflicts among other folk. Charismatic giants occasionally forged short-lived kingdoms in ultimately futile efforts to restore the glory of Ostoria, but giants have never again been a driving force in the history of the world as they were during the Dawn Ages.": "自奥斯托利亚陷落以来的近三万年里，巨人基本上都隐居起来，尽可能远离小民族定居点的扩散。巨人不时在其他民族的冲突中贡献自己的力量。富有魅力的巨人偶尔也会建立短暂的王国，试图恢复奥斯托利亚的荣耀，但最终都徒劳无功。",
	"If the giants of Oerth had a mighty empire founded by Annam in the distant past, that fact is not recorded in any of the extant histories of the world. Even so, many giants of Greyhawk revere the sons of Annam, though others have been lured into the service of demon lords or various elder evils.": "如果说在遥远的过去，奥尔斯巨人曾有过一个由阿南建立的强大帝国，但这一事实并没有记载在任何现存的世界历史中。即便如此，灰鹰的许多巨人仍然崇敬安南之子，不过也有一些巨人被引诱为恶魔领主或各种邪恶长老服务。",
	"During the Age of Dreams, the newly created peoples of Krynn awoke to the first dawn of the world. The first to awaken were a Giant folk known as irda, whose myths claimed they were shaped by the hands of the gods. (Some interpreters of these myths identify the dragon queen Takhisis as their creator, while giant scholars on other worlds believe Annam must have had a part in their creation.) The irda quickly established the first mighty nation of the young world, subjugating humans as their empire grew. The irda ruled for thousands of years, but they fell into decadent cruelty and their empire gradually declined until their human servitors overthrew them.": "在梦幻时代，新诞生的克莱恩人民在世界的第一道曙光中苏醒。最先苏醒的是被称为伊尔达的巨人族，他们的神话声称他们是由众神之手塑造的。(这些神话的一些解释者认为龙后塔克西丝是他们的创造者，而其他世界的巨人学者则认为安南一定参与了他们的创造）。伊达人很快建立了年轻世界的第一个强大国家，随着帝国的发展，他们征服了人类。伊达人统治了数千年，但他们陷入了腐朽残忍的境地，帝国逐渐衰落，直到他们的人类仆从推翻了他们。",
	"From the ashes of a mythic war between angelic and demonic forces that left the primeval world in ruins, an empire of giants was born on the mysterious continent of Xen'drik. The giants dominated Xen'drik for millennia, ruling over many smaller peoples—including elves who chafed under their rule. When the might of the giants began to wane, the elves rebelled. As the giants prepared to use world-shattering magic to smite the elves, the dragons of far-off Argonnessen attacked Xen'drik and brought about the fall of the giants' civilization.": "天使和恶魔的神话战争让原始世界变成了一片废墟，在这场战争的灰烬中，一个巨人帝国在神秘的 Xen'drik 大陆上诞生了。巨人统治了 Xen'drik 长达千年之久，统治着许多较小的民族，包括在他们统治下苦苦挣扎的精灵。当巨人的力量开始减弱时，精灵们开始反抗。就在巨人准备使用毁灭世界的魔法消灭精灵时，远在阿贡内森的巨龙袭击了仙德里克，导致巨人文明的衰落。",
	"Some giants still live among the ruins of their ancient civilization, though both their numbers and their sophistication are greatly diminished since the fall of their empire. Other giants left Xen'drik and now live alongside smaller peoples. Giants have been known to study in the universities of the Five Nations, to lead bands of marauders in Droaam, and to trade with dwarf miners far beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.": "一些巨人仍然生活在他们古老文明的废墟中，不过自从他们的帝国灭亡后，他们的数量和复杂程度都大大降低了。还有一些巨人离开了 Xen'drik，现在与较小的民族生活在一起。众所周知，巨人在五国的大学里学习，在德鲁阿姆率领掠夺者队伍，并与远在地表下的侏儒矿工进行交易。",
	"The giants of Eberron do not tell legends of Annam the All-Father, nor do they adhere to the rigid structure of the ordning. This might be another example of the effects of Eberron's isolation from the rest of the multiverse, but it is also possible that Annam abandoned his children at the fall of their ancient empire, just as he did on other worlds, and they have since forgotten him entirely.": "艾伯伦的巨人并不讲述万物之父安南的传说，也不遵循僵化的秩序结构。这可能是艾伯伦与多元宇宙其他地方隔绝的另一个例子，但也有可能是安南在他们的古老帝国灭亡时抛弃了他的孩子们，就像他在其他世界所做的那样，他们从此完全忘记了他。",
	"Giant Runes and Dwarvish Script": "巨型符文和矮人文字",
	"When Annam created the giants, he also taught them language and gave them runes of power. These symbols are pictographs: each symbol represents a whole word or concept rather than a single letter or sound. Each rune holds latent magical power, much like the glyphs inscribed in magic circles of protection, teleportation circles, and magical traps like the (%0%) spell. Thus, the first giants treated these runes as a sacred secret and rarely wrote them.": "安南在创造巨人时，也教给他们语言，并赋予他们力量符文。这些符文是象形文字：每个符号代表一个完整的词或概念，而不是单个字母或声音。每个符文都蕴含着潜在的魔法力量，就像刻在魔法保护圈、传送圈和魔法陷阱（如 (%0%) 咒语）中的字形一样。因此，最初的巨人将这些符文视为神圣的秘密，很少书写它们。",
	"It wasn't until long after the first flourishing of the giants' culture that the introduction of the Dwarvish script—an alphabetic set of symbols, where each glyph represents a single sound—made transcribing the Giant language an easier task. To this day, most written forms of the Giant language use the (%0%) (as described in the (%1%)), and the knowledge of Giant runes is rare except among those who study magical writing.": "直到巨人文化首次兴盛后很久，矮人文字--一套字母符号，每个字形代表一个声音--的引入才使得巨人语言的转写变得容易。时至今日，大多数巨人语言的书面形式都使用（%0%）（如（%1%）中所述），除了研究魔法文字的人之外，巨人符文的知识非常罕见。",
	"One of my first encounters with giants was also the last thing I did at my old friend (and former foe) Mordenkainen's side. He claims to this day that no cleric was available to restore me to life, only a druid, but he can't hide his smirk when he says it.": "我与巨人的第一次邂逅，也是我在老朋友（曾经的敌人）莫登凯宁身边做的最后一件事。他至今还声称，当时没有牧师能让我起死回生，只有德鲁伊，但他说这话时难掩冷笑。",
	"Most adventurers have heard tales of giants and their ilk. But for some adventurers, their connection to giants runs deeper than fanciful stories.": "大多数冒险者都听过巨人及其同类的故事。但对有些冒险者来说，他们与巨人的联系远比虚构的故事更深。",
	"This chapter is for any D&D character who aspires to forge a link to the mighty giants. From sources of havoc-wreaking power to the artful study of rune magic, from boons that imbue an individual with giant-like might to fantastic tales that can shape an adventurer's entire life—giants can make both big and small impacts on a character's story.": "本章适用于任何渴望与强大巨人建立联系的 D&D 角色。从破坏力量的来源到符文魔法的艺术研究，从赋予个人巨人般力量的恩赐到可以塑造冒险者一生的奇幻故事--巨人可以对角色的故事产生或大或小的影响。",

	"Giants are long-lived compared to humans, though not as much as their semidivine ancestors. Their life spans generally correspond with their place in the ordning, with hill giants living about two centuries and storm giants as many as six. Stone giants are the exception, sometimes reaching over eight hundred years of age, as enduring as the stone for which they're named. The Life Spans table shows the average life span of each kind of giant within the ordning. (Other creatures of the Giant type live about as long as humans, on average.)": "与人类相比，巨人很长寿，但不如他们的半神祖先。他们的寿命一般与他们在星际中的地位相对应，山丘巨人的寿命大约为两个世纪，风暴巨人则长达六个世纪。石巨人是个例外，有时能活到八百多岁，就像他们的名字所代表的石头一样经久不衰。寿命表显示了该州每种巨人的平均寿命。(其他巨人类生物的平均寿命和人类差不多）。",
	"In keeping with their long life spans, giants tend to live their lives at a slower pace than smaller folk. They often speak slowly and avoid rushing into decisions. Adding potential confusion to their interactions with smaller races, giants are often comically out of touch with happenings in the wider world, keeping a store of knowledge about Humanoid realms and peoples that was already outdated when they learned it as children. The Ancient Behaviors table suggests some ways you can communicate a giant's age in an encounter.": "巨人的寿命很长，因此他们的生活节奏往往比矮小的人慢。他们说话通常很慢，避免仓促做出决定。巨人与较小种族的互动可能会造成混乱，因为巨人经常与更广阔的世界脱节，他们保存着关于类人王国和民族的知识，而这些知识在他们孩提时代学习时就已经过时了。远古行为表中建议了一些在交锋中交流巨人年龄的方法。",

Don't yell at your players, but consider raising your voice a little, and perhaps gently shaking the table to demonstrate how the earth trembles at the giant's footsteps. Finding ways to emphasize a giant's volume can help everyone at the table appreciate the scale of the encounter.

	"Many giants are taught that Annam begot the giants and intended them to rule the worlds of the Material Plane. Though giants have learned many hard lessons in the millennia since their origin, a sense of self-importance still pervades their stories and inflates their vanity. It can be hard for a 16- to 7.8-metre-tall giant to take 3- to 2.1-metre-tall Humanoids and their concerns seriously. Use the Proud Behaviors table to inspire your portrayal of giants' pride and vanity.": "许多巨人都被告知，安南孕育了巨人，并打算让他们统治物质界的世界。虽然巨人在诞生后的几千年里吸取了许多惨痛的教训，但他们的故事中仍然充斥着自大感，并膨胀了他们的虚荣心。身高 16 到 7.8 米的巨人很难认真对待身高 3 到 2.1 米的类人生物和他们所关心的问题。使用 \"骄傲的行为 \"表格来激发您对巨人的骄傲和虚荣的描述。",

	"As described in the (%0%), the giants of many worlds organize themselves in a complex social ranking called the ordning. At the largest scale, the ordning establishes the relative positions of the six main kinds of giants, with (%1%) at the top, followed (in order) by (%2%), (%3%), (%4%), and (%5%), with (%6%) at the bottom. Other creatures of the Giant type—such as (%7%), (%8%), and (%9%)—are not counted as part of the ordning, placing them functionally below the hill giants.": "正如（%0%）中所描述的，许多世界的巨人以一种名为 \"秩序\"（ordning）的复杂社会等级来组织自己。在最大的尺度上，ordning 规定了六种主要巨人的相对位置，(%1%) 位于顶端，（按顺序）依次是 (%2%)、(%3%)、(%4%) 和 (%5%)，(%6%) 位于底端。其他巨人类型的生物，例如 (%7%)、(%8%) 和 (%9%)，不被算作秩序的一部分，因此它们在功能上低于山丘巨人。",
	"At a smaller scale, every giant has a precise place within the larger framework of the ordning, and each kind of giant has a different way of assigning that place. Cloud giants rank themselves based on wealth, fire giants based on crafting skill, frost giants based on physical strength, and stone giants based on a combination of artistry and rock throwing. Hill giants give their respect to larger and stronger giants without putting much thought into hierarchical ranks. Only storm giants, largely solitary and imagining themselves above such petty concerns, have no interest in ranking themselves. Regardless of a giant's ranking within its kind, no giant can transcend the ordning of the six giant kinds; the most accomplished fire giant artisan ranks below the poorest cloud giant, for example.": "在更小的范围内，每个巨人在更大的帝国框架内都有一个精确的位置，而每种巨人都有不同的分配方式。云巨人根据财富排序，火巨人根据工艺排序，霜巨人根据体力排序，石巨人则根据艺术和投石的结合排序。山丘巨人尊重体型更大、更强壮的巨人，而不考虑等级的划分。只有暴风巨人，他们大多独来独往，认为自己超越了这些琐事，对自己的等级没有兴趣。无论巨人在同类中的排名如何，没有巨人能超越六种巨人的等级；例如，最有成就的火巨人工匠的等级低于最穷的云巨人。",
	"For any given giant (except a storm giant), you can use the Giants and the Ordning table to determine the giant's place within the ranking of that particular giant kind, and the giant's attitude toward that place. Four more tables provide suggestions for how a cloud, fire, frost, or stone giant's efforts to retain or achieve a high status within the ordning might drive adventures. (Hill and storm giants aren't included here because of their limited participation in the ordning.)": "对于任何特定的巨人（暴风巨人除外），你都可以使用 \"巨人和秩序表 \"来确定该巨人在特定巨人种类中的地位，以及巨人对该地位的态度。还有四张表格提供了云巨人、火巨人、冰霜巨人或石头巨人如何努力保持或获得高地位的建议。(这里不包括山丘巨人和风暴巨人，因为它们在领地中的参与度有限）。",

	"A stone giant tries to manipulate characters into killing a fierce rival.": "一个石巨人试图操纵人物杀死一个劲敌。",
	"Some giants reject the ordning, in part or entirely. This rejection most commonly takes one of three forms.": "一些巨人部分或完全拒绝接受该条例。这种拒绝通常有三种形式。",
	"First are giants who hold themselves to a different standard than the one their kind traditionally values. These are often giants whose ranking within their kind is low. For example, a contemplative cloud giant might pursue knowledge rather than wealth, or a weak frost giant might trade in secrets and blackmail to hold onto some measure of power. These giants might avoid the company of their own kind to escape the expectations and customs attached to the ordning. In addition, devotees of Annam's daughters—Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra—tend to push against the strict definitions of the ordning as a matter of principle.": "首先是巨人，他们对自己的要求与同类的传统标准不同。这些巨人通常在同类中地位低下。例如，沉思的云巨人可能会追求知识而非财富，而弱小的冰霜巨人可能会通过秘密和勒索来掌握一定的权力。这些巨人可能会避免与自己的同类为伍，以逃避人们对他们的期望和附带的习俗。此外，安南的女儿--希提亚、伊拉妮斯和戴安卡斯特拉的信徒们也倾向于在原则问题上反对 \"爵位 \"的严格定义。",
	"Second, a few giants take a revolutionary stance meant to upset the ordning. A mighty frost giant warrior, not content to rule only frost giants and lesser creatures, could attempt to subjugate fire or cloud giants. Such revolutionaries often aim to impose their own kind's understanding of the ordning on all kinds of giants, so a master artisan among the fire giants might attempt to claim a higher place than storm giants who lack the same crafting skill. These efforts rarely have any lasting impact, but some have managed to upset the ordning at a local level for a few centuries. Because their sense of the ordning relies on physical power and military strength, frost giants are the most likely to impose their standards on other giants. Along similar lines, sometimes giants measure themselves by the standards of a different kind of giant and try to break from the ordning by exceeding those standards. A strong stone giant, for example, might try to claim a place within the frost giants' ordning.": "其次，少数巨人会采取革命性的立场，以扰乱秩序。一个强大的冰霜巨人战士不满足于只统治冰霜巨人和较小的生物，他可能会试图征服火巨人或云巨人。这些革命者通常会将自己对条例的理解强加给所有巨人，因此火巨人中的工匠大师可能会试图获得比缺乏同样工艺的风暴巨人更高的地位。这些努力很少能产生持久的影响，但有些人却能在几个世纪内扰乱当地的秩序。由于冰霜巨人对 \"秩序 \"的理解依赖于体力和军事力量，因此他们最有可能将自己的标准强加给其他巨人。同样，有时巨人也会以另一种巨人的标准来衡量自己，并试图通过超越这些标准来打破族规。例如，强壮的石巨人可能会试图在冰霜巨人的族群中占据一席之地。",
	"Third, giants who turn from the worship of Annam's children to other powers (as described under \"(%0%)\" later in this chapter) also reject the ordning. In some cases, as in the hierarchical cults of Elemental Evil, the new religion replaces the giants' ordning with a different structure that offers the same sense of order, purpose, and meaning. Such cults place giants at a higher position than the giants would otherwise enjoy in the ordning.": "第三，从崇拜安南之子转而崇拜其他力量的巨人（如本章后面\"（%0%）\"部分所述）也会拒绝接受教规。在某些情况下，比如在元素邪恶的等级崇拜中，新的宗教以一种不同的结构取代了巨人的教规，但却提供了同样的秩序感、目的和意义。这种邪教将巨人置于比巨人在教规中更高的地位。",
	"When giants join the cults of demon lords, they reject the entire concept of the ordning—the idea that there is any kind of order to the multiverse at all, which is the literal meaning of the word (%0%) in the Giant tongue. These giants reject meaning, status, and hierarchy in favor of chaos and destruction.": "当巨人加入恶魔领主的邪教组织时，他们拒绝接受 \"秩序\"（ordning）的整个概念--即认为多元宇宙存在任何秩序，这也是巨人语中\"%0%\"一词的字面意思。这些巨人摒弃了意义、地位和等级制度，转而追求混乱和毁灭。",
	"The Rejecting the Ordning table offers adventure hooks inspired by these ideas, illustrating how giants' attitudes toward the ordning can impact characters and the lives of Humanoids who live near them.": "拒绝 \"秩序 \"表格提供了受这些想法启发的冒险钩子，说明巨人对 \"秩序 \"的态度会如何影响角色以及生活在他们附近的人类的生活。",
	"A giant wanders into a settlement of Humanoids looking for an opportunity to use talents the giant's kin do not value, but the giant is greeted with suspicion and hostility. The giant seeks adventurers to help negotiate peace with the settlement.": "一个巨人闯入了一个类人居住区，他想寻找机会利用巨人的亲属不重视的才能，但巨人遭到了怀疑和敌视。巨人寻求冒险者帮助与定居点进行和平谈判。",
	"Characters must find a wise giant who has pursued specialized knowledge instead of excellence within the ordning.": "角色必须找到一位追求专业知识而非卓越的智慧巨人。",
	"A giant tries to use the characters as pawns in a scheme to subvert the ordning and increase the giant's status.": "巨人试图利用这些角色作为棋子，以颠覆法令，提高巨人的地位。",
	"A charismatic leader gathers giants of different kinds into a mighty war band, intending to conquer and settle lands inhabited by Humanoids who seek adventurers' protection.": "一位魅力非凡的领导者召集了不同种类的巨人，组成了一支强大的战队，打算征服并定居在寻求冒险者保护的类人族居住的土地上。",
	"A (%0%) asks adventurers to kill a revolutionary before the ordning is irrevocably disrupted.": "A (%0%) 要求冒险者在军令遭到不可逆转的破坏之前杀死一名革命者。",
	"A family of giants joined a cult of Elemental Evil and quickly took over the leadership, sorting its membership into a new hierarchy and creating dissension within the ranks—which the adventurers can use as they try to foil the cult's evil schemes.": "一个巨人家族加入了元素邪恶邪教，并迅速接管了领导权，将其成员分成新的等级，并在队伍中制造不和--冒险者可以利用这些不和来挫败邪教的邪恶计划。",
	"A giant serving a demon lord attacks a town. The town's leaders ask the characters to retaliate against the giant's kin—which is exactly what the demon cultist was hoping for.": "一个侍奉恶魔领主的巨人袭击了一个小镇。小镇的领导者要求角色们对巨人的亲属进行报复--这正是恶魔崇拜者所希望的。",
	"A group of giants seeks adventurers to deal with a surge of demon cult activity within the giants' community.": "一群巨人在寻找冒险者，以应对巨人社区内激增的恶魔崇拜活动。",
	"Most giants believe Annam established the ordning at the very beginning and that it reflects the birth order of his sons. One myth likens the ordning to the structure of the mountains: from lowly foothills ((%0%)), up to the stone of the mountain ((%1%)), the snow on the peaks ((%2%)), the lava spewing from the peak of a volcano ((%3%)), and then above the peak to the clouds ((%4%)) and the storm ((%5%)). These myths depict the ordning as an inherent part of what it means to be a giant, as natural as the geography of the land.": "大多数巨人认为，安南从一开始就建立了秩序，它反映了安南儿子的出生顺序。有一个神话将 \"顺序 \"比作山脉的结构：从低矮的山麓（%0%）到山石（%1%）、山峰上的雪（%2%）、火山顶上喷出的岩浆（%3%），再到山峰之上的云层（%4%）和风暴（%5%）。这些神话描述了作为巨人的一个固有组成部分，就像这片土地的地理环境一样自然。",
	"Sagas told among giants on some worlds suggest other explanations for the ordning, linking it to the giants' fall from Annam's good graces. In some of these stories, the ordning isn't natural at all; it's part of the giants' fall—an invention of Annam's sons and a distortion of Annam's will for them. In other stories, it is a consequence of their fall—a punishment Annam inflicted on the giants after they proved themselves incapable of governing the world. The ordning might be necessary, or a burden giants are expected to bear, but giants who hold these views often look forward to Annam abolishing the ordning in some mythic future.": "一些世界的巨人传奇故事对 \"徽章 \"提出了其他解释，认为 \"徽章 \"与巨人失去安南的宠爱有关。在其中一些故事中，\"徽章 \"根本不是自然形成的；它是巨人堕落的一部分--是安南的儿子们发明的，扭曲了安南对他们的旨意。在其他故事中，它是巨人堕落的后果--在巨人证明自己没有能力管理世界后，安南对他们施加的惩罚。法令可能是必要的，也可能是巨人必须承受的负担，但持这种观点的巨人往往期待着安南在某个神话般的未来废除法令。",
	"Giants on some worlds (including Eberron) have no concept of the ordning at all. Such giants might think of themselves as a single species, with the differences among giant kinds reflecting a cultural or geographical distinction rather than an inherent one. They might live in bands composed of multiple giant kinds or family groups of a single kind. Or giants of different kinds might not recognize each other as kindred at all. All these giants build a range of social structures in the same manifold ways other peoples do, without regard to an overarching ordning.": "有些世界（包括伊伯龙）的巨人根本没有 \"阶级 \"的概念。这些巨人可能认为自己是一个单一的物种，巨人种类之间的差异反映的是文化或地理上的区别，而不是与生俱来的。他们可能生活在由多个巨人种类组成的群体中，也可能生活在由单一种类组成的家族群体中。或者不同种类的巨人可能根本不承认彼此是同类。所有这些巨人都以与其他民族相同的多种方式建立了一系列社会结构，而不考虑总体秩序。",
	"The myths of giants across the Material Plane differ in many details, but most of them portray giants as descendants of a progenitor god, typically Annam, the All-Father. Giants believe they are nearly divine, and they are inclined to view their existence as part of a mythic story that is still unfolding. Unlike some other powerful, ancient creatures (such as dragons), giants don't typically exalt themselves and demand worship from lesser beings. Rather, they are often drawn to follow gods—and sometimes other powerful beings—who help them live out their part in that epic saga.": "物质位面的巨人神话在许多细节上都有所不同，但大多数神话都将巨人描绘成始祖神的后裔，通常是万物之父安南。巨人相信自己近乎神灵，他们倾向于将自己的存在视为仍在发展的神话故事的一部分。与其他一些强大的远古生物（如龙）不同，巨人通常不会自高自大，要求低等生物对他们顶礼膜拜。相反，他们通常会追随神灵，有时也会追随其他强大的生物，这些神灵会帮助他们完成自己在史诗传奇中的使命。",

	"Most giants revere a pantheon of gods comprising Annam and his divine children—a pantheon they call \"the Ordning\" because it is the archetype of the ordning that structures giant society. The head of the pantheon is the All-Father, but most giants view him as a remote, disinterested, or deeply disappointed father who has little role to play in giant life any more. The other ten gods, generally recognized as his children, are more important in most giants' view. The Gods of the Ordning table summarizes key information about these gods.": "大多数巨人崇敬由安南和他的神子组成的万神殿--他们称之为 \"秩序之殿\"，因为它是构建巨人社会的秩序原型。万神殿的首领是万神之父，但大多数巨人认为他是一个遥远的、不感兴趣的或深感失望的父亲，在巨人的生活中已经没有什么作用了。在大多数巨人看来，被普遍认为是他的孩子的其他十位神更为重要。奥德宁之神表格总结了这些神的主要信息。",
	"Annam is a complicated figure, depicted in a variety of ways in myths told across countless worlds of the Material Plane. These stories have been altered in the telling over the course of thousands of years. In some myths, he is the creator of worlds, and other gods merely populated the worlds Annam made with peoples of their own creation. Such myths often describe an ancient era when giants were the only people inhabiting the worlds, or giants shared the worlds with dragons. In other myths, Annam worked with other gods to create worlds together.

Still other myths describe Annam as a sleeping god whose dreams formed the substance of reality and allowed other gods to create within it.": "安南是一个复杂的人物，在物质界无数世界的神话中都有不同的描述。数千年来，这些故事在流传过程中不断变化。在一些神话中，他是世界的创造者，而其他神只是在安纳姆创造的世界里居住着他们自己创造的人。这些神话通常描述了一个远古时代，巨人是世界上唯一的居民，或者巨人与龙共享世界。在其他神话中，阿南与其他神一起创造了世界。(在本书的（%1%）中讲述了一部分（%0%），描述了安纳姆收集第一世界（巴哈姆特和提亚马特最初的创造物）的碎片，并将它们散布到物质界，创造了无数个世界。还有一些神话将安纳姆描述成一个沉睡的神，他的梦境形成了现实的实质，并允许其他神在其中创造。",
	"Annam is often described as an all-knowing god whose deep learning, profound meditations, and expansive philosophy offer endless wisdom for his descendants to study. Occasionally, he's more of a trickster figure whose escapades across the worlds are greeted with uproarious laughter and serve as cautionary tales.": "安南经常被描述为无所不知的神，他渊博的学识、深邃的冥想和广博的哲学为后人提供了无尽的智慧。有时，他更像是一个诡计多端的人物，他在各个世界的逃亡经历都会引起哄堂大笑，并成为警世故事。",
	"Giants on most worlds agree that Annam is no longer active in the affairs of giants in the Material Plane. Some say he despaired over his quarreling children. Others believe he lost hope in his descendants when their ancient empires fell into ruin. Some claim he was weakened after a long battle against his brother, Memnor (who is more commonly described as one of Annam's sons), and was forced to withdraw from the world until he regained his strength. Other dubious tales suggest he fled the Material Plane to escape the consequences of some misadventure.": "大多数世界的巨人都认为，安南已经不再积极参与物质界巨人的事务。有人说他对争吵不休的孩子们感到绝望。还有人认为，当他的子孙后代的古老帝国走向灭亡时，他对他们失去了希望。有人说他在与兄弟梅姆诺（通常被描述为安南的一个儿子）的长期战斗后变得虚弱，被迫退出世界，直到恢复元气。其他可疑的传说则认为他逃离物质界是为了逃避某些不幸事件的后果。",
	"Thanks to his prolonged absence from mortal giants' affairs, Annam has few priests. On some worlds, he has no priests and his name is all but forgotten. On other worlds, a priest of Annam serves as an adviser and mediator to scattered groups of giants, traveling extensively to visit far-flung communities. In some places, priests of Annam are great kings who rule over realms comprising different giant kinds. Even on worlds where Annam's priests are important, many giants (sometimes including his priests) are convinced Annam no longer hears the prayers of his people.": "由于长期不参与凡人巨人的事务，安南的祭司寥寥无几。在某些世界，他没有祭司，他的名字几乎被遗忘。在其他世界，安南祭司是分散的巨人群体的顾问和调解人，他四处奔波，访问遥远的社区。在有些地方，安南祭司是伟大的国王，统治着由不同种类巨人组成的王国。即使在安南祭司很重要的世界，许多巨人（有时包括他的祭司）也确信安南不再聆听他的子民的祈祷。",
	"Diancastra is the youngest child of Annam, born of a mortal giant mother shortly before Annam retreated from the Material Plane. The saga of her effort to claim her full divine inheritance is a popular tale among giants who value guile and trickery over brute strength or magical might. The tale is also beloved because it offers hope that Annam might emerge from his self-imposed exile if his descendants can restore his faith in them.": "黛安卡斯特是安纳姆最小的孩子，在安纳姆从物质位面撤退前不久由一位凡人巨人母亲所生。她努力获得全部神力继承权的传奇故事在巨人中广为流传，因为他们看重的是奸诈和诡计，而不是蛮力或魔法力量。这个故事之所以深受喜爱，还因为它给人们带来了希望：如果安南的后代能够恢复他对后代的信心，他就有可能摆脱自我放逐。",

	"Annam's youngest son and Karontor's younger twin is Grolantor, a brash braggart who takes enormous pride in his great strength (which some would say is his only redeeming quality). Tales of Grolantor's exploits highlight his strength and his insatiable hunger, and most of them end with him in conflict with one of his siblings. To hill giants, these stories make Grolantor a figure to be admired. Among the other giants, Grolantor is the butt of every joke, always coming out poorly in comparison to his siblings. Those giants think he is a selfish boor who has no respect for the ordning, as Grolantor refuses to see why his status should not be equal to that of Stronmaus and his other brothers.": "格罗兰托是安南的小儿子，也是卡隆托尔的小孪生兄弟。格罗兰托是个粗鲁的吹牛大王，他以自己强大的力量为傲（有人说这是他唯一的优点）。格罗兰托的故事突出了他的力量和贪得无厌的饥饿感，其中大部分故事都以他与兄弟姐妹中的一个发生冲突而告终。对于山地巨人来说，这些故事让格罗兰托成为一个值得敬佩的人物。在其他巨人中，格罗兰托是每个笑话的笑柄，与他的兄弟姐妹相比，他总是出师不利。这些巨人认为他是一个自私自利、不尊重秩序的粗人，因为格罗兰托不明白为什么自己的地位不能与斯特朗默斯和其他兄弟相提并论。",
	"In addition to hill giants, some frost giants admire Grolantor's physical might, and many ogres and ettins revere him as well. Grolantor exemplifies the principle that the strong should take what they want, without regard for the needs of weaker creatures. The ordning holds no meaning for hill giants—who are on the bottom rung—or ogres and ettins, who are even lower. The only social order they recognize is \"might makes right.\"": "除了山丘巨人之外，一些冰霜巨人也钦佩格罗兰托的身体力量，许多食人魔和艾汀人也敬仰他。格罗兰托体现了强者为尊的原则，他们想要什么就应该得到什么，而不考虑弱小生物的需要。秩序对于山丘巨人--他们是最底层的--以及食人魔和艾丁人--都没有任何意义。他们唯一认可的社会秩序就是 \"强权即公理\"。",
	"Grolantor's priests often boast of having experienced a personal interaction with their god—a dream, waking vision, or even an encounter with a manifestation of Grolantor. These encounters typically involve the god demanding something he wants from the priests, such as a fresh kill or a precious trinket. His priests then demand (and often take by force) sacrifices for Grolantor from their kin, with a minimum of ritual or prayer involved.": "格罗兰托的祭司们经常吹嘘自己与他们的神有过亲密接触--梦境、清醒时的幻象，甚至与格罗兰托的化身相遇。在这些邂逅中，神灵通常会向祭司们索要他想要的东西，比如新鲜的猎物或珍贵的饰品。然后，他的祭司们会要求（通常是强行）他们的亲属为格罗兰托献祭，其中只涉及最低限度的仪式或祈祷。",
	"Hiatea is Annam's second child, after Stronmaus, and the companionship and friendly rivalry between these two oldest children are the focus of many myths. In these stories, Hiatea is both a protective figure who keeps watch over the hearths and fields of giants, blessing their agriculture and their family lives, and a wild huntress who wields the power of nature as a weapon of destruction as well as a source of bounty. Some myths suggest her mother hid her among firbolgs after her birth, where Hiatea focused on strengthening communities. Then, when she learned of her true parentage, she pursued arduous quests as a hunter and monster slayer to prove her worth to her father. (It's possible that (%0%), excerpted in the (%1%) to this book, alludes to this story when Annam compares Diancastra's deeds to Hiatea's.) Another myth suggests Stronmaus taunted Hiatea for remaining aloof from a bitter war against dragons, spurring her to prove herself a valiant warrior as well as a champion of peaceful giants.": "希阿忒亚是安南的第二个孩子，仅次于斯特朗默斯，这两个最年长的孩子之间的伙伴关系和友好竞争是许多神话的焦点。在这些故事中，希阿忒亚既是一个保护者，看守着巨人的炉灶和田地，保佑他们的农业和家庭生活；又是一个野性十足的女猎人，挥舞着大自然的力量，既是毁灭的武器，也是丰饶的源泉。一些神话认为，希阿忒亚出生后，她的母亲把她藏在冷杉林中，希阿忒亚在那里专注于巩固社区。后来，当她知道自己的真实身世后，为了向父亲证明自己的价值，她开始了艰苦的猎人和怪物猎人之旅。(本书（%1%）节选的（%0%）可能暗指了这个故事，当时安南将戴安卡斯特拉的事迹与希阿忒亚的事迹进行了比较）。另一个神话认为，斯特朗默斯嘲笑希阿忒亚在与龙的苦战中置身事外，激励她证明自己是一名英勇的战士，同时也是和平巨人的捍卫者。",
	"Giants of all kinds offer prayers to Hiatea, ranging from simple blessings at the kindling of a hearth fire to thanksgivings at the conclusion of a successful hunt or harvest. She is the most popular god of the Ordning among goliaths and firbolgs, who claim a distant kinship with giants.": "各种类型的巨人都会向希阿忒亚祈祷，从点燃炉火时的简单祝福，到狩猎或丰收后的感恩。在声称与巨人有远亲关系的巨人和冷杉巨人中，她是奥丁最受欢迎的神。",

Some live within the giants' enclaves and focus their efforts on maintaining the community, tending to agriculture, and educating children. Others patrol the wilderness surrounding the enclave, guarding against threats to the community.": "希阿提阿的祭司们扮演着两种角色中的一种，反映出神的双重关注领域。一些祭司住在巨人的飞地中，主要负责维护社区、照料农业和教育儿童。其他人则在飞地周围的荒野中巡逻，防范对社区的威胁。",
	"Born about the same time as Grolantor, Iallanis is everything her boorish brother is not: kind, loving, merciful, joyful, and thoughtful. She loves every part of the worlds her father made, and she constantly strives to bring not only her divine family but also mortal giants together in harmony. Iallanis envisions a restored giant empire as a realm of benevolence, learning, and innovation where giants lead but do not rule like tyrants.": "伊亚兰尼斯与格罗兰托差不多同时出生，她的粗鲁哥哥所没有的一切她都拥有：善良、慈爱、仁慈、快乐和体贴。她热爱父亲创造的世界的每一部分，她不断努力，不仅要让她的神圣家族和谐相处，还要让凡人巨人和谐相处。在伊亚兰尼斯的设想中，恢复后的巨人帝国是一个充满仁慈、学习和创新的国度，巨人在这里领导一切，而不是像暴君一样统治一切。",

Stone giants frequently appeal to her as an artistic muse, trusting that her love of beauty will inspire their work.": "善良的巨人欣赏她的理想，向伊亚兰尼斯祈祷和平、团结和仁慈。她的祭司经常为巨人主持婚礼，即使是邪恶的巨人。石巨人经常把她当作艺术缪斯，相信她对美的热爱会激发他们的创作灵感。",
	"Karontor is the elder twin of Grolantor. In a handful of myths, Karontor appears as a wicked schemer whose hatred of his brothers knows no bounds. The fomorians once occupied a place in the ordning corresponding to Karontor's place, but then Karontor incited the fomorians to assault the Feywild. Just as the fomorians were banished into the Underdark, so too did Annam banish Karontor to a subterranean prison.": "卡隆托尔是格罗兰托尔的孪生哥哥。在一些神话中，卡隆托尔是一个邪恶的阴谋家，他对兄弟的仇恨无以复加。弗莫瑞亚人曾在圣域中占据过与卡隆托尔相对应的位置，但后来卡隆托尔煽动弗莫瑞亚人袭击了费奥王国。就像弗莫瑞亚人被放逐到暗黑世界一样，安南也将卡隆托尔放逐到了地下监狱。",
	"Few dare to worship Karontor, even in secret. Superstitious giants believe if his name is spoken, Karontor might burrow up from the Underdark to drag the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of torture. To avoid uttering his name, giants sometimes refer to him as \"the banished son,\" \"the forgotten one,\" or \"the king that crawls.\" A few cults revere him, beseeching him for sinister magical secrets or to consume their enemies.": "很少有人敢崇拜卡隆多，即使是秘密崇拜。迷信的巨人相信，如果说出他的名字，卡隆多就会从幽暗地底钻出来，将无助的说话者拖入地底，永远受尽折磨。为了避免说出他的名字，巨人有时称他为 \"放逐之子\"、\"被遗忘者 \"或 \"爬行之王\"。少数崇拜者敬仰他，向他祈求邪恶的魔法秘密或吞噬他们的敌人。",
	"When it comes to Memnor, the wisest policy is the simplest: don't believe a single thing you read.": "说到 Memnor，最明智的政策就是最简单的：不要相信你读到的任何东西。",
	"Memnor is an ambiguous figure in the mythology of giants, and the tales concerning him are so disparate that it's possible two gods exist with the same name. More likely, the confusion surrounding his nature and identity is a result of his own duplicity. In most myths, Memnor is constantly tricking and infuriating his father, drawing Annam's wrath down on himself and (more often) his brothers. In one myth, Memnor is Annam's sinister twin, constantly challenging his brother for control of the worlds. In this tale, Annam defeated Memnor but was left so weakened by the contest that Annam fled to his private sanctum, leaving his children to govern the affairs of the giants.": "在巨人神话中，梅姆诺是一个模棱两可的人物，有关他的传说千差万别，甚至有可能存在两个同名的神。更有可能的是，他自身的两面性导致了他的本质和身份的混乱。在大多数神话中，梅姆诺不断欺骗和激怒他的父亲，将安南的怒火引向自己和（更常见的是）他的兄弟们。在一个神话中，梅姆诺是安南阴险的孪生兄弟，不断挑战哥哥对世界的控制权。在这个故事中，安纳姆打败了梅姆诺，但却因为这场较量而变得非常虚弱，安纳姆逃回了自己的私人圣殿，留下他的孩子们管理巨人的事务。",
	"Memnor is typically described as clever and persuasive on the one hand, and as sly and manipulative on the other. His brothers often suspect him of trying to usurp Annam's place at the head of the Ordning to rule all the affairs of giantkind. Among mortal giants, the same accusation is often leveled against his priests. But giants who revere him for his charisma and intellect insist he has the welfare of all giants at heart, seeking to restore them to their proper place at the head of all creation.": "梅姆诺通常被描述为一方面聪明、有说服力，另一方面狡猾、善于操纵。他的兄弟们经常怀疑他试图篡夺安南在奥丁之首的位置，统治巨人族的一切事务。在凡人巨人中，他的祭司也经常受到同样的指责。但是，那些崇敬他的魅力和智慧的巨人坚持认为，他是以所有巨人的福祉为重，力图恢复巨人在万物之首的应有地位。",
	"Memnor has wicked priests within his fold who emulate his duplicity, his self-interest, and his manipulative ability to make others do exactly what he wants—usually to their own detriment. These priests often undermine or exploit the ordning to their own benefit. Without careful investigation, it's impossible to separate these villains from the ranks of those priests of Memnor who faithfully serve the ordning, acting as advisers and advocates at every rank of giants' society.": "梅姆诺的信徒中有一些邪恶的祭司，他们效仿梅姆诺的阴险狡诈、自私自利和操纵他人的能力，使他人完全按照他的意愿行事--通常对自己不利。这些牧师经常为了自己的利益破坏或利用圣会。如果不仔细调查，就无法将这些恶棍与那些忠心耿耿为圣令服务、在巨人社会的各个阶层充当顾问和代言人的梅姆诺祭司区分开来。",
	"Despite being the fifth of Annam's sons, Skoraeus (called \"Stonebones\" by his stone giant followers) is depicted as the wisest among them, particularly knowledgeable about magic, wards, hidden treasures, and the secrets of the earth. It is said he gave Surtur the secret of smelting, showed Thrym how to carve magic runes on weapons, and crafted spears for Hiatea so she could complete her tasks of valor. A dour loner, Skoraeus often sits on the sidelines during the schemes and battles of his siblings. He appears in one myth after other as an observer, a confidant to the other gods, and a keeper of secrets.": "尽管斯科莱厄斯是安南的第五个儿子，但他被石巨人的追随者们称为 \"石骨\"，被描绘成石巨人中最有智慧的人，尤其精通魔法、魔法阵、隐藏的宝藏和大地的秘密。据说他将冶炼的秘密传授给了苏图尔，向特瑞姆展示了如何在武器上雕刻魔法符文，还为希阿忒亚制作了长矛，使她能够完成英勇的任务。斯科莱厄斯是个沉闷的独行侠，在兄弟姐妹的阴谋和战斗中，他经常袖手旁观。他以旁观者、其他诸神的知己和秘密守护者的身份出现在一个又一个神话中。",
	"Giants invoke Skoraeus's name when they begin any work of art or craft, particularly stonework, and they often dedicate the final product to his glory. Stone giants pray to Stonebones, the Great Creator, in a much broader range of circumstances, eager for divine insight as they carry out their daily lives. His priests undertake frequent pilgrimages into the Underdark, seeking revelation from Skoraeus in the depths of the earth.": "巨人在开始任何艺术或手工艺工作，尤其是石雕工作时，都会唤起斯科拉俄斯的名字，他们通常会将最终产品献给他的荣耀。石巨人在更广泛的情况下向伟大的造物主斯通伯恩祈祷，渴望在日常生活中得到神的启示。他的祭司们经常前往幽暗之城朝圣，从大地深处寻求斯科莱厄斯的启示。",
	"Annam's eldest child is jovial Stronmaus, whose greatest failing in myth is his inability to see the foolishness, jealousy, and outright evil that festers in the souls of his brothers. His boundless energy, sunny optimism, and zest for life pervade the legends that tell of his many mighty deeds. A few tales, though, describe a dramatic change in Stronmaus after his father's withdrawal from the Ordning, which left Stronmaus effectively in charge of the pantheon. Since then, Stronmaus has become brooding, aloof, and melancholy, deeply frustrated with his inability to unite the gods of the Ordning—and hurt by his father's abandonment.": "安南的长子是活泼开朗的斯特朗默斯，他在神话中最大的缺点是看不到兄弟们灵魂深处的愚昧、嫉妒和彻头彻尾的邪恶。他精力充沛，阳光乐观，对生活充满热情，他的许多伟大事迹在传说中随处可见。不过，也有一些传说描述了斯特龙默斯在他父亲退出神殿后发生的巨大变化，这使得斯特龙默斯实际上成了万神殿的掌权者。从那时起，斯特朗默斯变得忧郁、冷漠和悲伤，他对自己无法团结神殿中的众神深感沮丧，也因父亲的离弃而受到伤害。",
	"All giants acknowledge Stronmaus's place on the throne of the gods in Annam's absence, but to most of them, he is but a steward, an inadequate substitute for the All-Father. They offer the required prayers and sacrifices (a scattering of fragrant herbs and incense on the wind each morning), but their prayers often sound more like a list of grievances than honest worship. His priests are drawn from giants who occupy high positions within the ordning of their kind, including wealthy cloud giants, strong frost giants, and accomplished stone giants. Being a priest of Stronmaus has no effect on a giant's rank in the ordning; instead, it often makes the giant a target of resentment and complaints from other giants.": "所有巨人都承认斯特朗默斯在安南不在时在众神宝座上的地位，但对他们中的大多数人来说，他只是一个管家，不足以替代万物之父。他们按要求祈祷和献祭（每天清晨随风撒下芬芳的草药和香），但他们的祈祷往往听起来更像是一连串的抱怨，而不是真诚的崇拜。他的祭司来自在同类中身居高位的巨人，包括富有的云巨人、强壮的霜巨人和有成就的石巨人。成为斯特朗默斯的祭司并不会影响巨人在部落中的地位，相反，这往往会让巨人成为其他巨人怨恨和抱怨的对象。",
	"Surtur is the elder twin of Thrym, and rivalry has driven the two gods from the moment of their birth. Surtur is generally depicted as the cleverer of the two, often outwitting his brother in contests where Thrym's greater strength might otherwise let him prevail. Their history of competition ranges from striving to outdo each other in childhood accomplishments to bloody battles that ended only when their father or one of their siblings intervened. Other myths describe cunning Surtur leading his brother on dangerous adventures, typically leaving mayhem and destruction in their wake. Aside from his escapades involving Thrym, Surtur is known for his unsurpassed skill at metalwork, especially forging weapons and armor.": "苏图尔是特林的孪生长兄，从他们出生的那一刻起，竞争就驱使着这两个神。苏图尔通常被描绘成两个神中最聪明的一个，他经常在比赛中胜过他的哥哥，否则特林可能会以更强大的力量获胜。他们的竞争历史从童年时努力超越对方的成就，到血腥的战斗，直到他们的父亲或兄弟姐妹之一介入才结束。其他神话还描述了狡猾的苏图尔带领弟弟进行危险的冒险，通常会造成混乱和破坏。除了与 Thrym 有关的冒险活动外，苏图尔还以精湛的金属工艺而闻名，尤其是锻造武器和盔甲。",
	"Giants pray to Surtur in search of creative inspiration and ask his blessing on their smithies. They invoke his name when they light forges, kilns, and ovens. Among fire giants, the worship of Surtur is often tinged with the expectation of a coming battle that will destroy worlds, slay many gods, and upend the ordning, leaving fire giants as the undisputed masters of all creation. Surtur's fire giant priests stoke the flames of this expectation when they address Surtur as \"the All-Consuming Flame\" or \"the Cleansing Fire.\" Some priests stockpile weapons—ranging from ordinary swords and axes to magical devices of devastating potential—in preparation for this great battle.": "巨人向苏图尔祈祷，寻找创作灵感，并祈求苏图尔保佑他们的铁匠铺。他们在点燃锻炉、窑炉和烤炉时都会呼唤他的名字。在火巨人中，对苏尔特尔的崇拜往往带有对即将到来的一场大战的期待，这场大战将毁灭世界，杀死众多神灵，颠覆秩序，让火巨人成为无可争议的万物之主。苏图尔的火巨人祭司在称呼苏图尔为 \"吞噬之火 \"或 \"净化之火 \"时，都会煽起这种期望的火焰。一些祭司囤积武器，从普通的剑和斧头到具有毁灭性潜力的魔法装置，为这场伟大的战斗做准备。",
	"As Surtur's younger twin, Thrym is described in myths as his brother's rival and coconspirator. He is depicted as the stronger and braver of the two, and he often comes out on top in contests and conflicts where those qualities outweigh Surtur's cleverness. Thrym is often described as a bully, frustrated that Annam seemed to favor Surtur; he vents that frustration by harassing his younger brother Skoraeus. Thrym appears in myth as the greatest warrior of the Ordning. He leads bands of mortal giants in raids and skirmishes, bringing glory to giantkind and striking terror into the enemies of Annam's children.": "作为苏图尔的小孪生兄弟，特林在神话中被描述为哥哥的对手和同谋。他被描绘成两人中更强壮、更勇敢的人，在比赛和冲突中，他常常胜过苏尔特尔的聪明才智。特林经常被描述成一个恶霸，他对安南似乎偏爱苏尔特尔感到沮丧；他通过骚扰弟弟斯科莱厄斯来发泄这种沮丧。在神话中，Thrym 是 Ordning 最伟大的战士。他带领一队凡人巨人进行突袭和小规模战斗，为巨人族带来荣耀，并让安南子民的敌人感到恐惧。",
	"Giants sometimes ask Thrym for his blessing before hunting or going to war, and they pour out blood from their kills to thank Thrym for their success. Thrym's priests are war leaders who offer military counsel to the leaders of giant communities.": "巨人有时会在狩猎或出征前请求特瑞姆的祝福，他们会倒出杀戮的鲜血来感谢特瑞姆的成功。特瑞姆的祭司是战争领袖，他们为巨人族群的首领提供军事建议。",
	"Annam's withdrawal has caused ongoing upheaval in the religious lives of giants across the Material Plane. Most believe Annam turned from his descendants in anger or disappointment, and many hope he can be convinced to return to his divine throne if the giants restore their ancient glory. But some giants believe that Annam is dead, that he is petulant and unworthy of worship, or that he will never reclaim his throne. Some of these giants look for purpose in the service of other gods or powers. Giants who remain faithful to the gods of the Ordning call these other powers \"interloper gods,\" believing they are trespassing on the territory of Annam's children and intruding into the affairs of giants. A giant who worships these gods violates the ordning; giants' proper place in the multiverse is above such monstrous beings as demon lords, elemental evils, and gods who are not Annam's children, so it is upside-down for a giant to serve these entities. Giants who follow interloper gods are cast out of society if they are discovered, but they believe the benefits of serving those powers outweigh the risk of exile.": "安南的退出给整个物质界的巨人宗教生活带来了持续的动荡。大多数人认为，安纳姆是因为愤怒或失望而离开了他的后裔，许多人希望，如果巨人能恢复他们古老的荣耀，就能说服他重返神圣的宝座。但也有一些巨人认为，安南已经死了，他脾气暴躁，不值得崇拜，或者他永远不会夺回王位。这些巨人中的一些人寻找为其他神灵或力量服务的目标。忠于奥丁神的巨人称这些其他势力为 \"入侵者之神\"，认为他们侵犯了安南子民的领地，干涉了巨人的事务。崇拜这些神的巨人违反了秩序；巨人在多元宇宙中应有的地位高于恶魔领主、邪恶元素和非安纳姆子民的神灵等畸形生物，因此巨人侍奉这些实体是颠倒是非的。追随外来神灵的巨人一旦被发现就会被驱逐出社会，但他们认为侍奉这些神灵的好处大于被流放的风险。",

The god is described as a greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Indeed, legend suggests (%0%) formed from Vaprak's blood in the same way he came from Annam's, and many trolls venerate him. Some ogres and giants also worship Vaprak, particularly giants who despair of ever rising in the ordning.": "有些神话认为瓦普拉克是安南的孩子，因此属于奥丁，但也有神话说他是安南的鲜血所化。由于种种原因，他从未获得与万物之父其他孩子同等的地位。瓦普拉克被称为 \"毁灭者\"，喜欢无意识地大肆破坏。据描述，瓦普拉克神是一种绿色生物，非常像巨怪。事实上，传说（%0%）是由瓦普拉克的血液形成的，就像他来自安南的血液一样，许多巨怪都崇拜他。一些食人魔和巨人也崇拜瓦普拉克，尤其是那些对在星际中崛起感到绝望的巨人。",
	"Service to a demon lord is tempting to many giants, particularly those frost and hill giants who value size and strength above all. For these giants, demon worship paradoxically offers both freedom from the strictures of the ordning (and from the notion of a cosmic order more generally), and exactly the kind of power their ordning rewards. Of the countless rulers of the infinite Abyss, four have particular influence among giantkind.": "为恶魔领主服务对许多巨人都很有诱惑力，尤其是那些看重体型和力量的冰霜巨人和山丘巨人。对这些巨人来说，恶魔崇拜既能让他们摆脱族规的束缚（以及更普遍的宇宙秩序观念），又能让他们获得族规所奖励的力量。在无尽深渊的无数统治者中，有四位在巨人族中具有特殊的影响力。",
	"As described in the (%0%), Baphomet the Horned King encourages his followers to embrace their fundamentally bestial nature. Giants who delight in the frenzy of battle and bloodshed are easily lured to the demon lord's service. Stone giants who feel stifled and repressed by their society sometimes break free in dramatic fashion by embracing Baphomet's creed (see the (%1%) in (%2%)).": "正如（%0%）中所描述的那样，角王巴弗灭鼓励他的追随者们接受自己的兽性。那些喜欢狂热战斗和流血的巨人很容易被引诱为恶魔领主服务。感到被社会压抑的石巨人有时会通过接受巴弗灭的信条，以戏剧性的方式挣脱束缚（见 (%2%) 中的 (%1%)）。",
	"Demogorgon has few followers among the giants of the ordning, but ettins often recognize a kindred spirit in the two-headed demon lord. The (%0%) in (%1%) is an ettin cultist who has received Demogorgon's hideous gifts.": "德摩戈尔金在奥丁巨人中很少有追随者，但艾丁人经常能从双头恶魔领主身上找到同类的精神。(%1%)中的(%0%)是一个接受了德摩戈尔贡狰狞礼物的艾丁崇拜者。",
	"Though he is not terribly important in the Abyss, the demon lord Kostchtchie is revered by many giants, particularly frost giants. Part of his appeal is his willingness (when bribed with bloody offerings) to inspire his worshipers with ferocity and bloodlust. More than any other demon lord, what he offers his followers—raw strength and fury in battle—appeals directly to the values shared by many frost giants, making him appear as an exemplar of the giants' ideals. The (%0%) in (%1%) is an example of a frost giant whose devotion to the demon lord has brought great and terrible rewards. ((%2%) is described in (%3%).)": "虽然恶魔领主科斯特奇在深渊中并不十分重要，但却受到许多巨人，尤其是冰霜巨人的尊崇。他的魅力之一在于他愿意（用血腥祭品贿赂）激发崇拜者的凶残和嗜血欲望。与其他恶魔领主相比，他为追随者提供的东西--原始力量和战斗怒火--直接迎合了许多冰霜巨人的共同价值观，使他成为巨人理想的典范。(%1%)中的(%0%)就是一个冰霜巨人的例子，他对恶魔领主的忠诚带来了巨大而可怕的回报。((%2%)在(%3%)中有所描述)。",
	"Gnolls, ghouls, and some hill giants share two strange commonalities: insatiable hunger and a tendency to serve the demon lord Yeenoghu. Sometimes a hill giant who delights in senseless slaughter turns to the Beast of Butchery for help in achieving more senseless slaughter. Occasionally, an indiscriminately hungry hill giant consumes some item of unspeakable corruption and takes on a fiendish nature, falling under Yeenoghu's sway. In either case, the result is a horrible monster with a gullet akin to the bottomless Abyss itself (see the (%0%) in (%1%)).": "地精、食尸鬼和一些山丘巨人有两个奇怪的共同点：贪得无厌的饥饿感和侍奉恶魔领主耶诺古的倾向。有时，以无意义的屠杀为乐的山丘巨人会向屠戮之兽求助，以获得更多无意义的屠杀。有时，一个饥不择食的山丘巨人吃下了某种无法形容的腐败物品，从而变得凶残成性，受到耶诺古的控制。不管是哪种情况，结果都是一个可怕的怪物，它的大口就像无底深渊一样（见 (%1%) 中的 (%0%)）。",
	"Another popular avenue for giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning derives from giants' close ties to the Elemental Planes. The nameless horror called the Elder Elemental Eye perverts natural elements, limiting them to their most destructive aspects in a way that appeals to giants who are disposed toward evil. More than most members of individual Elemental Evil cults, giants see the big picture of the four cults working toward the common goal of elemental cataclysm. Some giants even worship the Elder Elemental Eye directly rather than serving one of the subordinate cults.": "巨人与元素界关系密切，这也是巨人背离奥丁之神的另一个流行途径。被称为 \"长老元素之眼 \"的无名恐怖生物会扭曲自然元素，将它们限制在最具破坏性的一面，这对趋向邪恶的巨人很有吸引力。与大多数元素邪教成员相比，巨人更能看到四大邪教为元素大灾难这一共同目标而努力的全貌。有些巨人甚至直接崇拜长老元素之眼，而不是为某个下属邪教服务。",
	"As described earlier in this chapter (see \"(%0%)\"), membership in the cults of Elemental Evil replaces the ordning with a different hierarchy—one in which giants gravitate toward the top. Giants who worship Elemental Evil alongside smaller peoples offer welcome physical (and sometimes magical) power to these cults, making them an even more significant force in the world. Intelligent and charismatic giants might enter positions of leadership in an elemental cult, while less cunning giants might become lieutenants or personal bodyguards of cult leaders.": "正如本章前文所述（见\"(%0%)\"），元素邪恶邪教的成员资格以不同的等级制度取代了军衔制度--在这种等级制度中，巨人趋于顶端。与较小的民族一起崇拜邪恶元素的巨人为这些邪教提供了可喜的身体（有时是魔法）力量，使他们成为世界上更重要的力量。聪明且富有魅力的巨人可能会在元素邪教中担任领导职务，而不那么狡猾的巨人可能会成为邪教领袖的副手或贴身保镖。",

	"Giant cultists of Olhydra are mostly frost giants who see ice and cold as ultimate expressions of water's destructive power. They believe the seas and deep waters are eager to reclaim the water trapped in the bodies of living creatures and feel duty-bound to return others to the primal waters by drowning them, shedding their blood, or freezing them in ice.": "奥利希拉的巨人崇拜者大多是冰霜巨人，他们将冰和寒冷视为水的破坏力的终极体现。他们认为海洋和深海渴望收回困在生物体内的水，并认为自己有责任通过淹死、放血或冰冻的方式将其他人送回原始水域。",
	"Fire giants who join Imix's cult yearn to burn away the impurities of the world in volcanic eruptions and uncontrolled fires, creating a wasteland of ash ruled by fiery Imix alone. They believe the world and all its peoples are wicked and degenerate and seek to purify the world by reducing it to smoking cinders.": "加入伊米克斯邪教的火巨人渴望通过火山爆发和无节制的大火烧掉世界上的杂质，创造一片由炽热的伊米克斯独自统治的灰烬荒原。他们认为世界和世界上所有的人都是邪恶和堕落的，并试图通过将世界化为冒烟的焦炭来净化世界。",
	"Giants who follow Yan-C-Bin and his air cult, mostly cloud and a few storm giants, worship the devastating power of wind and storms. They aren't generally interested in destruction for its own sake, but they delight in the power to punish those who have wronged them and to express personal freedom through mayhem.": "追随严丙彬和他的空气崇拜的巨人，大多是云巨人，也有少数风暴巨人，他们崇拜风和风暴的破坏力。一般来说，他们对破坏本身并不感兴趣，但他们乐于用这种力量来惩罚那些伤害过他们的人，并通过混乱来表达个人的自由。",
	"Some giants devote themselves to other powerful primordial creatures of the Elemental Planes, such as Maegera the Inferno, Mual-Tar the Thunder Serpent, and Draunn the Stonemaw. In practice, cults devoted to these primordials have similar aims and methods to cults of Elemental Evil.": "有些巨人会献身于元素界其他强大的原始生物，如地狱迈格拉（Maegera）、雷蛇穆尔塔（Mual-Tar）和石爪德伦（Draunn）。实际上，对这些原始生物的崇拜与对元素邪恶生物的崇拜有着相似的目的和方法。",
	"Like other peoples, giants may choose to give their service and devotion to many different gods, not just the children of Annam or particular cults. On some worlds, the gods of the Ordning are unknown (perhaps forgotten) or known by different names. There, giants might have their own gods or worship the same gods other peoples do.": "和其他民族一样，巨人可能会选择侍奉和献身于许多不同的神灵，而不仅仅是安南的子民或特定的邪教。在某些世界，奥丁神不为人知（或许已被遗忘），或以不同的名字为人所知。在那里，巨人可能有自己的神，也可能崇拜与其他民族相同的神。",

Planted and tended by the god Corellon, this tree was a seedling of the mighty Yggdrasil, the World Tree that connects all the Outer Planes.

	"Giants of the Worldroot Circle tell this story as a way to remember their purpose. They imagine themselves to be Annam's gardeners, tasked with tending the roots of all the worlds he made. On some worlds, they literally tend a great world tree they believe to be a seedling of the tree on the First World. On other worlds, they believe some other geographical feature is the \"root of the world,\" such as a towering mountain or mesa, a yawning cavern deep under the mountains, or a meteorite in an enormous crater.

	"Giants are dangerous foes. The encounter tables in this section are most suitable for use with characters in the third tier of play (levels 11–16). If you're creating giant-themed encounters for lower-level characters, you might use more dangerous creatures in the background to establish the setting of the adventure, or use them in a nonhostile capacity. For example, if you're creating encounters for a 6th-level party, a fight against two storm giants would make for a dreadfully one-sided battle. Instead, the characters could witness the giants in an altercation from a distance, foreshadowing a conflict that will threaten all the smaller folk in the region. Or you could decide the giants are indifferent or friendly toward the characters, leading to a dramatic interaction that might offer hooks to adventures more appropriate to your party's level. See the \"Giants and Tiers of Play\" sidebar for more advice.": "巨人是危险的敌人。本节中的奇遇表最适合第三级角色（11-16 级）使用。如果是为低级角色创建以巨人为主题的奇遇，可以在背景中使用更危险的生物来建立冒险的背景，或者以非敌对的身份使用它们。例如，如果您为六级角色创建奇遇，那么与两个风暴巨人的战斗将是一场可怕的一面倒的战斗。相反，角色们可以从远处目睹巨人的争吵，预示着一场将威胁到该地区所有小民的冲突。或者你可以决定巨人对角色漠不关心或友好相处，从而引发一场戏剧性的互动，为更适合角色等级的冒险提供线索。更多建议请参阅 \"巨人和游戏等级 \"边栏。",

	"D&D worlds often assume some magic items (especially artifacts) were created in ancient times using long-forgotten techniques.

	"In the mythic history of most D&D worlds, giants occupy a privileged place—alongside dragons—among the first sapient creatures to walk the earth. Elves and dwarves arose or arrived on most worlds later, and other peoples are generally considered by these ancient folk to be younger in terms of the history of these worlds. Considering the relationships among these ancients—both in history and in their current form—can be an interesting way to develop a campaign that prominently features giants.": "在大多数 D&D 世界的神话历史中，巨人与巨龙一样，是最早出现在地球上的有智慧生物。精灵和矮人出现或到达大多数世界的时间较晚，而这些古人通常认为其他民族在这些世界的历史中更为年轻。考虑这些古人之间的关系--无论是在历史上还是以他们现在的形式--对于开展以巨人为主角的活动来说都是一种有趣的方式。",
	"The history of the giants and these other ancient peoples doesn't need to be important in your world, but it might have long-lasting implications. In the Forgotten Realms, giants and dragons sometimes nurse grudges against each other stemming from the Thousand-Year War that devastated their ancient empires millennia ago. Even for such long-lived creatures, twenty-five thousand years is a long time to hold a grudge. In your world, there might never have been conflict between giants and dragons, or they might have long ago set aside any lingering resentment. Perhaps giants and dragons banded together in ages past in a desperate effort to survive the rise of younger peoples. Or evil giants might have sided with chromatic dragons while good giants took up arms alongside metallic dragons in the long-running conflict between the children of Bahamut and the children of Tiamat.": "巨人和这些其他古老民族的历史在你的世界中不一定很重要，但可能会产生长久的影响。在被遗忘的国度，巨人和龙有时会因为千年前的千年战争而互相记恨，这场战争摧毁了他们的古老帝国。即使对这种长寿生物来说，两万五千年也是一段很长的记仇时间。在你们的世界里，巨人和龙之间可能从未发生过冲突，或者他们早已放下了任何积怨。也许在过去的岁月里，巨人和龙为了在年轻族群的崛起中幸存下来，不惜联合在一起。或者邪恶的巨人可能与色龙站在一起，而善良的巨人则在巴哈姆特之子和提亚马特之子的长期冲突中与金属龙并肩作战。",
	"Similarly, many D&D worlds feature an ancient history of conflict between dwarves and giants. This enmity is visible most clearly in certain magic items originally made by dwarves to be highly effective against giants (and other creatures of the Giant type): the (%0%), (%1%), and the (%2%). Often this history of conflict is assumed to be simply a matter of fighting over territory, since both dwarves and giants often prefer to live in mountainous regions. But the myths told by both giants and dwarves on some worlds describe the conflict extending into the divine realms as well. The god Moradin, who is revered by many dwarves, is said to loathe the evil giant gods. But you might decide the dwarves and giants of your world have a long history of friendly relations, or that dwarves often side with good giants in opposition to the schemes and depredations of evil giants. Perhaps dwarves are frequently the subjects of giant-ruled realms in the mountains, living peaceful and prosperous lives under beneficent storm giant rulers or toiling in poverty under fire giant tyrants.": "同样，在许多 D&D 世界中，矮人和巨人之间也有着一段古老的冲突历史。这种敌意最明显地体现在某些最初由矮人制造的对巨人（和其他巨人类型的生物）非常有效的魔法物品上：（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。由于矮人和巨人通常都喜欢居住在山区，所以人们通常认为这种历史上的冲突仅仅是为了争夺领地而发生的。但在一些世界中，巨人和矮人讲述的神话将冲突延伸到了神界。许多矮人敬仰的莫拉丁神据说厌恶邪恶的巨人神。但你可能会认为你们世界的矮人和巨人有着悠久的友好关系，或者矮人经常与善良的巨人站在一起，反对邪恶巨人的阴谋和掠夺。也许矮人经常是巨人统治的山中王国的臣民，他们在仁慈的风暴巨人统治者的统治下过着和平富足的生活，或者在火焰巨人暴君的统治下过着贫困潦倒的生活。",
	"Most D&D worlds' histories don't include any particular animosity between elves and giants. Perhaps in your world, elves and giants have coexisted peacefully in separate regions of the world. Or maybe they warred fiercely: an (%0%) (a spear that is otherwise identical to a (%1%) warhammer) might be a magic relic of those ancient battles. Perhaps elves and giants worked together to bring an end to evil dragons' dominion over the young world, and the two peoples maintain a sense of mutual respect.": "在大多数 D&D 世界的历史中，精灵和巨人之间并没有特别的仇恨。也许在你的世界中，精灵和巨人在不同的地区和平共处。或者他们曾经激烈交战：一把 (%0%) （在其他方面与 (%1%) 战锤相同的长矛）可能是那些古代战争的魔法遗物。也许精灵和巨人共同努力结束了恶龙对年轻世界的统治，两个民族保持着相互尊重的意识。",
	"You might also decide to create a campaign where the conflicts among the ancients, like the Thousand-Year War between giants and dragons in the Forgotten Realms, are not a matter of ancient history but a present reality. You could build an entire campaign in the shadow of such a conflict, which is basically taking the ideas described under \"(%0%)\" earlier in this chapter and extending them through many adventures.": "您也可以决定创建一个战役，在这个战役中，古人之间的冲突，比如被遗忘的国度中巨人和龙之间的千年战争，并不是古代历史，而是现在的现实。你可以在这种冲突的阴影下建立整个战役，这基本上是将本章前面\"（%0%）\"中描述的想法通过许多冒险进行扩展。",
	"The war might not be a simple two-sided conflict between giants and dragons. Perhaps elves, dwarves, good giants, and metallic dragons joined forces against a two-pronged assault from evil giants and chromatic dragons. Or war might be raging between dragons and elves while giants strive to protect smaller peoples from the fallout.": "战争可能不是巨人和龙之间简单的两方冲突。也许精灵、矮人、善良的巨人和金属龙联合起来，对抗邪恶巨人和色龙的双管齐下。又或者，龙和精灵之间的战争正在激烈进行，而巨人则在努力保护较小的民族免受战争的影响。",
	"Other peoples and monsters might be involved. The war might be a largely subterranean clash between stone giants and mind flayers while dwarves and drow seek to escape the earth-shaking and cavern-collapsing aftershocks of battles. Or storm giants might combat krakens and other nightmares of the deep while coastal cities and merchant ships struggle to endure devastating storms and tidal waves.": "其他民族和怪物也可能卷入其中。战争可能主要是石巨人和意念剥离者之间的地下冲突，而矮人和乌鸦人则试图躲避地动山摇和洞穴坍塌的战斗余波。风暴巨人可能会与克拉肯人和其他深海噩梦作战，而沿海城市和商船则在努力抵御毁灭性的风暴和潮汐。",
	"The Thousand-Year War in the Forgotten Realms lasted a thousand years for good reason: neither giants nor dragons were ever particularly numerous, and actual skirmishes between giants and dragons were rare. For this reason, you could run a campaign where battles between the warring parties are isolated events along the lines of the world-shaking events described in \"(%0%).\" You might begin the campaign with one such battle, have the adventurers spend months or even years dealing with the aftereffects of the cataclysmic battle, then send your campaign in a new direction with a second battle. Maybe a third, truly cataclysmic battle—in which the adventurers are now high enough level to participate in the combat and turn it in favor of one side or the other—brings the campaign to a close.": "被遗忘的国度中的千年战争持续了一千年，这是有充分理由的：巨人和巨龙的数量都不是特别多，巨人和巨龙之间的实际小规模战斗也很少发生。因此，您可以按照\"（%0%）\"中描述的震撼世界的事件的思路来开展一场战役，在这场战役中，交战双方之间的战斗都是孤立的事件。你可以用一场这样的战役开始战役，让冒险者们花上几个月甚至几年的时间来处理这场大灾难战役的后遗症，然后用第二场战役将你的战役推向新的方向。也许第三场真正意义上的大灾难战役--冒险者的等级已经足够高，可以参与战斗，并使战斗向有利于一方或另一方的方向发展--将为战役画上句号。",
	"Another approach to making giants a significant part of your campaign is to feature them in the mythology of your world. (%0%) (see (%1%)) might feature prominently in these myths, as these examples illustrate.": "让巨人成为活动重要组成部分的另一种方法是在你的世界的神话中出现巨人。(%0%) （见 (%1%)）可能会在这些神话中占据重要地位，这些例子就说明了这一点。",
	"Giants stole secrets of knowledge and magic from the gods and shared them with Humanoids, thus helping the smaller folk build their first civilizations. For that crime, the giants have endured millennia of punishment at the hands of petty and vengeful gods. Some giants blame Humanoids for causing this punishment, but others still view helping and teaching smaller peoples as their responsibility. (Alternatively, maybe the giants were responsible for teaching Humanoids the evil use of magic and were justly punished for that sin.)": "巨人从众神那里窃取了知识和魔法的秘密，并与人族分享，从而帮助小民建立了最初的文明。因为这一罪行，巨人在渺小和复仇的神灵手中忍受了千年的惩罚。一些巨人责怪人族造成了这种惩罚，但其他巨人仍然认为帮助和教导较小的民族是他们的责任。(或者说，巨人有责任教导类人族邪恶地使用魔法，并因此受到了应有的惩罚）。",
	"Whether it's recorded in revered myth, passed on as casual folklore, or simply fact, giants shaped the landscape in the earliest days of the world. Gigantic boulders scattered across a rolling moor weren't deposited by receding glaciers—they were dropped (or intentionally placed) by giants. A great canyon wasn't worn away by eons of erosion; it was formed when a tired giant dragged her axe behind her after a long day of hewing trees (or dragons). The basalt columns visible at low tide connecting an island to the mainland aren't the result of volcanic activity but rather the craft of ancient giants. A crater or lake might be the place where an ancient giant stepped, slept, or fell after trying to climb the stars to reach Annam's palace. Elemental magic might linger in these places, making them likely locations for dungeons or monster lairs. Carefully sifting through these tales and plotting the locations on a map might reveal the path some ancient giant walked across the land, pointing to the location of a great mystery at the beginning or end of that journey.": "无论是记载在受人敬仰的神话中，还是流传于民间的偶然传说，抑或仅仅是事实，巨人塑造了世界早期的地貌。散落在连绵起伏的荒原上的巨石不是冰川消退后沉积下来的，而是巨人丢下（或有意放置）的。巨大的峡谷并不是经过漫长岁月的侵蚀而形成的；它是一个疲惫的巨人在砍了一天的树（或龙）之后，拖着斧头形成的。退潮时可见的连接岛屿和大陆的玄武岩柱不是火山活动的结果，而是远古巨人的杰作。火山口或湖泊可能是远古巨人在试图攀登星空到达安南宫殿后踏足、睡觉或坠落的地方。元素魔法可能会萦绕在这些地方，使其成为地牢或怪物巢穴的可能地点。仔细梳理这些传说，并在地图上标出这些地点，也许就能揭示古代巨人在这片土地上走过的道路，并在旅途的起点或终点找到一个巨大的谜团。",
	"In a world that is fundamentally inhospitable to life, giants are responsible for maintaining small areas where Humanoids can flourish. Perhaps storm and cloud giants control the weather to maintain small gardens of comfortable temperatures amid a world-spanning desert or frozen wasteland. The campaign might explore what happens to the inhabitants of one of these gardens when its giant caretaker falls ill or dies. Or the gardens might be the stuff of legend in a harsh world where the bravest explorers dare to search for them.": "在一个从根本上不适合生命生存的世界里，巨人负责维持一小片人类可以繁衍生息的区域。也许暴风巨人和云巨人可以控制天气，在漫无边际的沙漠或冰雪荒原中维持温度适宜的小花园。活动可能会探讨当这些花园的看护人生病或死亡时，花园里的居民会发生什么。或者，这些花园可能是严酷世界中的传奇故事，最勇敢的探险家也敢于去寻找它们。",
	"Six scions of giants' gods literally hold the world together. Perhaps they're responsible for holding the continents above the ocean surface or supporting the dome of the sky, or they might keep the world together through magical means. In any case, if these titans were killed, the world would dissolve into the Elemental Chaos.

	"Though Annam granted her wish for divinity, Diancastra still roams the worlds of the Material Plane, continuing the whimsical adventures told in numerous sagas. She is a trickster figure whose curiosity, acquisitiveness, and wanderlust constantly get her into sticky situations—and whose cleverness and occasional exertion of giant strength always get her out of those situations. Though she often appears disguised as a young storm giant, she can just as easily appear as a human, elf, or gnome, making her true identity almost impossible to discern. She enjoys a variety of worldly pleasures and delights in the company of mortal creatures of all kinds. She loves to learn more spells, preferring spells of the enchantment and illusion schools.": "虽然安南满足了她成为神的愿望，但戴安卡斯特仍在物质界的各个世界游荡，继续着无数传奇故事中异想天开的冒险。她是一个诡计多端的人物，她的好奇心、好胜心和流浪癖不断让她陷入困境，而她的聪明才智和偶尔发挥的巨力总能让她摆脱困境。虽然她经常伪装成年轻的暴风巨人，但她也能轻易地伪装成人类、精灵或地精，让人几乎无法辨别她的真实身份。她喜欢各种世俗的乐趣，并乐于与各种凡人生物为伴。她喜欢学习更多的法术，偏爱魔法和幻术流派的法术。",
	"Though her exploits seem to serve only her own desires, Diancastra does have a greater agenda: to convince Annam to emerge from his seclusion and restore the giants to their rightful place at the pinnacle of the created order.

	"The world has six scions of giants' gods, near-divine titans who are sleeping until Annam awakens them.
