	"I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn't until I discovered tabletop roleplaying games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same with me. I was spellbound.": "我经常从奇幻世界以及冒险、神秘和魔法书中找到灵感。我从小就爱不释手地阅读别人递给我的每一本小说，在别人的文字中寻找自我，并把它们在我脑海中唤起的画面导入我的素描本中。但直到我发现了桌面角色扮演游戏，我才真正感到有能力创造自己的世界，就像我经常迷失在其中的世界一样。更棒的是，它让我可以和朋友们分享我脑海中的所有想法，他们也可以和我做同样的事。我如痴如醉。",
	"It's been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I've drawn endless inspiration from the imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I've found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of improvisational brilliance. It's still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world; (%0%) has become a phenomenon that's surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the past few years, we've built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it's become a world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it's inspired you to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina's epic tale, the land of Tal'Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility... and we wanted to share it with you.": "从我第一次玩游戏至今已有二十五年。从那时起，我从朋友和爱人的想象力中汲取了无穷的灵感，我们围着桌子，用骰子和纸讲述英雄的故事。我找到了一个朋友圈子，他们和我一样热爱戏剧性的故事，相信游戏中的失败和成功一样令人兴奋（也许更令人兴奋），并乐于从即兴创作的精彩瞬间中获得灵感。我们找到了与世界分享的方式，这仍然是超现实的；(%0%) 已经成为一种现象，超越了我最狂野的梦想。在过去的几年里，我们一起建立了埃克桑德里亚这个神奇的世界，无论它有多少弊端，不知不觉中，它已经成为了一个让数百万人参与其中并投入想象力的世界。我希望它能激励你们创造自己的冒险、故事和快乐回忆。通过 Vox Machina 的史诗故事，塔尔多雷大陆成为了一个充满阴谋、冲突和无限可能的世界......我们希望与您分享。",
	"Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal'Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing, and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the (%0%) went into the world.": "多年前，我曾有机会将塔尔多雷人搬上纸面，邀请世人讲述他们自己在埃克桑德里亚的故事。这个机会让我兴奋不已，但巨大的压力和对失败的恐惧（因为我完全没有这样做的经验）让我在极短的时间内完成了一次艰苦的旅程。我非常幸运地与才华横溢的詹姆斯-海克（James Haeck）成为了朋友，我邀请他和我一起完成这项任务。我很幸运地得到了他的同意，在他的帮助和启发下，这件事终于完成了。就这样，(%0%)限量版问世了。",
	"Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina's greatest adventures came to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein in the land of Wildemount...but Vox Machina and Tal'Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question arose: what would Tal'Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?": "无论是在我们的世界，还是在埃克桑德里亚的世界，时间都已流逝。Vox Machina 最伟大的冒险就此结束。二十年后（在埃克桑德里亚），我们与强大的尼恩家族一起在怀尔德蒙特大陆展开了新的冒险......但我对沃克斯马奇纳和塔尔多雷依然情有独钟。问题来了：二十年后的塔尔多雷会是什么样子？在克罗玛会议和低语者登基之后，塔尔多雷会发生怎样的变化？Vox Machina 的传奇英雄们会如何适应他们故事结束后的生活？下一代英雄需要面对哪些新旧危险和威胁？",

	"Though this book concerns itself mostly with the world of Exandria, and specifically the continent of Tal'Dorei, high-level adventurers may eventually gain magic that allows them to travel to other planes of existence beyond the material world in which Exandria resides.": "虽然本书主要涉及埃克桑德里亚世界，特别是塔尔多雷大陆，但高级冒险者最终可能会获得魔法，使他们能够前往埃克桑德里亚所在的物质世界之外的其他世界。",
	"The planes surrounding Exandria are similar to the planes presented in fifth edition lore. Below are brief descriptions of some of the planes that a party of powerful adventurers may travel to. These planes go by many poetic and fanciful names.": "埃克桑德里亚周围的位面与第五版传说中的位面相似。下面简要介绍了一些强大的冒险者可以前往的位面。这些位面有许多充满诗意和幻想的名字。",
	"The Material Plane is a land where natural laws work as we expect. It is a place of all four elements, and of plants, animals, and minerals. Exandria is but one of many worlds on the Material Plane—though none but the most accomplished astronomers have become aware of this fact, much less devised a way of traveling between material worlds.": "物质界是自然法则按照我们的期望发挥作用的地方。这里有四种元素、植物、动物和矿物。埃克桑德里亚只是物质界众多世界中的一个--尽管除了最有成就的天文学家之外，没有人意识到这一事实，更不用说设计出在物质界之间旅行的方法了。",
	"When the Protean Gods discovered Exandria, it was like a barren ship adrift in a sea of churning, chaotic elements. As a part of their creation, the elements were thrust away from the world. Some theorize that the Elemental Planes were created from this banished chaos, while others believe the elemental chaos seeped into the Material Plane from tears in the fabric of the planes.": "当 Protean 众神发现埃克桑德里亚时，它就像一艘荒船，漂泊在汹涌混乱的元素之海中。作为创造的一部分，元素被从世界中驱逐出去。有些人认为元素位面就是从这些被驱逐的混沌中诞生的，而另一些人则认为元素混沌是从位面结构的裂缝中渗入物质位面的。",
	"The latter may be more likely, as rifts between the Elemental Planes can be found across Exandria. The largest of these rifts are tended to by the four Ashari civilizations, and any who gaze within find wild wastelands of pure elemental power: roiling seas of fire, towering mountains of gnashing stone, infinite skies filled with cloud-top settlements, and endless, stormy oceans of water.": "后者的可能性更大，因为在整个埃克桑德里亚都能找到元素界之间的裂缝。其中最大的裂缝由四个阿莎瑞文明负责管理，任何人进入其中都会发现纯粹元素力量的荒野：咆哮的火海、高耸的石山、布满云顶定居点的无垠天空，以及无边无际、狂风暴雨的汪洋大海。",
	"Parallel to Exandria are odd reflections of its reality. The Fey Realm is a plane of natural beauty and ferocity, inhabited by fey folk. The Plane of Shadow is a dour, sinister mirror of the world that is. And the Ethereal Plane is a hazy film across the material world, as if it were viewed through an old, cloudy mirror, inhabited not only by restless spirits, but also by predators that target those who cling to the world of the living.": "与埃克桑德里亚平行的是其现实的奇特映像。仙界（Fey Realm）是一个自然美丽而凶残的位面，居住着仙人。阴影位面是一面阴沉、险恶的镜子，照出了真实的世界。缥缈界是横跨物质世界的一层朦胧薄膜，就像通过一面古老而浑浊的镜子来观察世界一样，这里不仅居住着躁动不安的灵魂，而且还有掠夺者，他们的目标是那些依附于活人世界的人。",
	"All the prior planes exist directly adjacent to the Material Plane, buttressing and occasionally co-mingling with its inhabitants. All the planes that follow are separated from the material world by a vast sea of starlight, barren asteroids, and misty nebulae of unpredictable magic. In the ancient past, arcanists had to craft vessels to sail the treacherous sea of stars to travel between their home plane and the mysterious Outer Planes.": "所有先前的位面都直接毗邻物质位面，与物质位面的居民相依为命，偶尔也会混杂在一起。之后的所有位面都与物质世界隔着一片浩瀚的星海、贫瘠的小行星和魔法变幻莫测的缥缈星云。在远古时代，奥术师需要制作船只，在波涛汹涌的星海中航行，来往于他们的本位面和神秘的外位面之间。",
	"These days, magic such as the plane shift spell has allowed planar travelers to bypass these methods, but there are still a number of strange creatures and forgotten, imprisoned demigods who float eternally through the Cosmic Sea.": "如今，平面移动咒语等魔法已经允许平面旅行者绕过这些方法，但仍有一些奇怪的生物和被遗忘、被囚禁的半神在宇宙海中永恒地漂浮着。",
	"The (%0%) imprisoned the (%1%) in prison planes after the (%2%), and retired to planes of their own creation after the (%3%).

	"All of these planes are strongly aligned to one or more cosmic principles of good, evil, law, and chaos, based on the divine powers that reside there. Because of the Divine Gate established after the (%0%), no divine powers can depart these planes, for the sake of all Creation. The gods' supernatural creations can pass through the Divine Gate, though the more powerful they grow—and thus, the closer they come to divinity—the harder it is for them to pass through. However, mortals and lesser supernatural beings who possess magic to travel between the planes can travel to and from Outer Planes like the Hells, the Abyss, Elysium, and Pandemonium unhindered by the Divine Gate.": "根据居住在这些位面的神力，所有这些位面都与一个或多个善、恶、法则和混乱的宇宙原则紧密相连。由于在（%0%）之后建立了神力之门，为了所有造物主的利益，任何神力都不能离开这些位面。众神的超自然造物可以通过神门，不过它们越强大，也就越接近神性，就越难通过神门。不过，凡人和拥有魔法的较低级超自然生物可以来往于地狱、深渊、极乐世界和潘德蒙尼姆等外层位面，不受神门的阻碍。",
	"Far beyond even the divine Outer Planes is a realm where all laws of nature break down completely. Mortal senses have no way of properly perceiving the nature of these far-distant realms, and most minds that try to comprehend them snap under the strain of so much unfamiliar stimulus. These maddening realities and the alien horrors that live within them are mercifully kept away from the known multiverse by the unimaginable distance of space.": "即使在神圣的外层星球之外，也有一个完全打破自然法则的领域。凡人的感官无法正确感知这些遥远领域的本质，大多数试图理解它们的大脑都会在如此多陌生刺激的压力下崩溃。这些令人抓狂的现实和生活在其中的外星恐怖，被难以想象的太空距离隔绝在已知的多元宇宙之外。",
	"Some creatures of the beyond have lurked on the Material Plane since ancient times, perhaps at the invitation of the (%0%) itself, or because the divine powers unleashed in the (%1%) punched holes in time and space that allowed such aberrations to slither into Exandria unimpeded.": "自古以来，一些超凡生物就潜伏在物质位面，也许是受到了（%0%）本身的邀请，或者是因为（%1%）释放的神力在时间和空间上打出了洞，让这些异类畅通无阻地溜进了埃克桑德里亚。",

	"Massive, infinite spaces such as the Material, Elemental, and Outer Planes are not the only types of reality. Through the use of powerful magic, arcanists can create stable demiplanes—finite pockets of extraplanar reality that they can shape to their whims. These \"pocket dimensions\" exist as bubbles of floating color within the Cosmic Sea, and can only be traced or penetrated by extremely powerful, lost magical arts.": "物质位面、元素位面和外层位面等巨大而无限的空间并不是唯一的现实类型。通过使用强大的魔法，奥术师可以创造出稳定的半位面--星外现实的无限口袋，他们可以随心所欲地塑造这些口袋。这些 \"口袋维度 \"就像漂浮在宇宙海中的彩色气泡，只有通过极其强大的失传魔法才能追踪或穿透。",

The second sun brought the lush soil. The third wind carried breath of life. The fourth flame ignited the Heart of Exandria.": "......然后，无尽阴影的巨大空洞之心遭遇了探索者之光。洼地中涌出生命之泉。第一个月亮形成了无尽的海洋。第二个太阳带来郁郁葱葱的土壤。第三道风带来了生命的气息。第四朵火焰点燃了埃克桑德里亚之心。",
	"Where did Tal'Dorei come from? The origin of this land is a time-shrouded question that everyone has pondered in some way, from the most exalted, world-traveling hero to the common farmer who has never traveled three miles beyond their village. Everyone has their own ideas on where Tal'Dorei, and all of the wide world of Exandria, came from. These varied thoughts all have some things in common, since they are all born of jumbled misunderstandings of ancient myths told orally from bard to bard, then passed from father to daughter, and eventually codified into religious re-writings of history that favor the teachings of a given deity.": "塔尔多雷从何而来？这片土地的起源是一个被时间笼罩的问题，每个人都曾以某种方式思考过这个问题，从最崇高的、周游世界的英雄，到从未走出村庄三英里的普通农民。关于塔尔多雷以及埃克桑德里亚广袤世界的起源，每个人都有自己的想法。这些不同的想法都有一些共同点，因为它们都源于对吟游诗人口口相传的古老神话的杂乱误解，然后由父亲传给女儿，最后被编纂成有利于特定神灵教义的宗教历史重写。",
	"To speak a full and accurate truth of Tal'Dorei is an impossible task, yet Tal'Dorei is known for creating folk who regularly do the impossible.

These two organizations have assembled this history by digging beneath the layers of dust and decay that hide battles long past, unearthing texts long thought burned and censored, and exhuming historical treasures from tombs of heroes long forgotten.

	"Before the history of the lands of Tal'Dorei can be explored, its context in the history of Exandria itself must be thoroughly established. The world of Exandria is home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous, dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.": "在探索塔尔多雷大陆的历史之前，必须先彻底了解埃克桑德里亚的历史背景。埃克桑德里亚世界拥有四大洲、数十个国家，在奇妙而危险的荒野中还有数不清的文明小块土地。从最大的帝国到最渺小的游牧部落，每个文明都对自己故事的起源有着自己的解释。即使在埃克桑德里亚世界，不同的文化都有创世神话，这些神话最终都与历史交汇在一起，但却没有一个已知的确切故事。",

	"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, and churning, gnashing rock. Through the ashen skies of Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. These ambitious divinities—young and still formless—looked down upon this roiling realm and saw potential for great strength and outstanding beauty, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.": "很久很久以前，这个世界充满了动荡和混乱的力量，只有肆无忌惮的火焰、汹涌澎湃的海洋和咆哮咆哮的岩石。穿越原始创世的灰暗天空，众神从以太之外的未知领域来到了这里。这些雄心勃勃的神灵--年轻而无形--俯瞰着这个汹涌澎湃的领域，看到了强大的力量和卓越的美貌的潜力，以及了解自己在创世中的位置的机会。",

	"As a note from the High Curator of (%0%) Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them—yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.": "正如（%0%）钴矿保护区高级馆长所言，《瓦塞尔海姆编年史》指出，只有当埃克桑德里亚的人民开始崇拜众神时，众神才被赋予了形体和名称--然而，世界上的许多不同种族都将自己的创造归功于一个或一群神。我们至少可以推测，虽然 Protean 众神缺乏独特的形式，但他们仍然有独特的思想、情感和动机，这些思想、情感和动机后来通过人们的崇拜被编纂成法典。",
	"As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the (%0%), (%1%), and (%2%) were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.": "随着来自天神的灵感，其他造物也接踵而至，诞生了埃克桑德里亚的众多民族。在这里，瓦塞尔海姆的神话记录越来越不清晰，因为虽然（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）无可否认地是埃克桑德里亚的第一批种族，但后来的许多创世之子的身份却没有被黎明之城的编年史家记录下来。",
	"These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.": "这些无数年轻的种族探索着他们刚刚建立的世界。随着知识的增长，他们尝试着进行建设。但是，这片土地凶猛而险恶，孩子们的生命被这个依然混乱的世界无情地扼杀了。看着孩子们在这片斥责他们的土地上挣扎，众神心中充满了悲伤。众神最终将自己的力量的微小碎片借给了他们的孩子，他们可以用这些礼物来塑造周围的世界。",
	"This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good—but fragile, and in need of guardians.": "诸神的这一小小的怜悯就是魔法的诞生，埃克桑德里亚的人们也因此学会了如何让愤怒的大地屈从于自己的意志，如何缓和爆炸的山脉的愤怒，如何驯服不屈的洪水，如何让坚硬的大地变得柔软而富饶。流浪的人们定居下来，语言变得普遍，生存让位于艺术，管理取代了无政府状态。灰烬天空之外的神灵--\"创造者之神 \"看到了进步，也看到了进步是好的--但却是脆弱的，需要守护者。",
	"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world.

Flames erupted from below with greater intensity than any had seen before. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world the gods had found: the Primordials. These elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to sunder it once more.

They tried to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on to start anew. Others wished to prove they could tame the world for their beloved children. This caused a divide among the gods. The schismatic deities, known today as the (%0%), joined their songs and swords to those of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their children into the image of their intent.": "有些神充满了悲愤，他们希望放弃这个世界，去另一个世界。他们试图说服自己的神灵同类，与元始天尊一起夺回混沌世界，这样他们就可以继续前进，重新开始。另一些人则希望证明自己能够为心爱的孩子们驯服这个世界。这导致了众神之间的分裂。分裂的神灵，也就是今天的（%0%），将他们的歌声和利剑与混乱和毁灭的歌声和利剑结合在一起，带走并扭曲他们的孩子，让他们变成自己想要的样子。",

	"The various peoples of Tal'Dorei don't have racial cultures. Rather, someone's culture is based on the cities and regions in which they spend their formative years. For most of Tal'Dorei's history, members of the different fantasy races lived in largely monolithic enclaves. However, the more recent past has instilled in people the need to break down old barriers, work together, and live together.": "塔尔多雷各族人民没有种族文化。相反，一个人的文化是基于他成长的城市和地区。在塔尔多雷的大部分历史中，不同幻想种族的成员基本上都生活在单一的飞地中。然而，近代以来，人们逐渐意识到需要打破旧有的隔阂，团结合作，共同生活。",

Dragonblood of Exandria can either be born with a tail or without. In Draconia, those with tails were called draconians or draconbloods, for they were seen as closer in form and power to true dragons. Those without tails were given the name of ravenites and enslaved. Their blood and toil built the mighty towers of Draconia, yet the ravenites enjoyed none of their city's splendor.": "德拉古尼亚的毁灭和许多人的丧生是一场悲剧。但对埃克桑德里亚大约一半的龙血人来说，这也标志着压迫政权的终结。埃克桑德里亚的龙血人要么天生有尾巴，要么天生没有尾巴。在德拉戈尼亚，有尾巴的龙血人被称为龙人或龙血人，因为他们在形态和力量上更接近真龙。没有尾巴的被称为乌鸦人，并被奴役。他们的鲜血和辛劳建造了德拉戈尼亚强大的塔楼，但乌鸦人却无法享受城市的辉煌。",
	"The ruin of Draconia thus marked the start of an era of freedom and self-determination for the ravenites. In Tal'Dorei, it's apparent that any differences between the ravenites and the draconians have nothing to do with bloodline or draconic power. Those differences are cultural, and rooted in a past whose conflicts still haven't been resolved. The oppression that existed in Draconia remains largely unknown within Tal'Dorei to this day, and outside of major cities such as (%0%), dragonblood can go for months, even years, without seeing another of their kind.": "因此，德拉古尼亚的毁灭标志着乌鸦人自由和自决时代的开始。在塔尔多雷，乌鸦人与龙人之间的差异显然与血统或龙人力量无关。这些差异源于文化，源于冲突仍未解决的过去。在德拉古尼亚存在的压迫至今在塔尔多雷仍鲜为人知，在（%0%）等大城市之外，龙血人可能几个月甚至几年都见不到其他同类。",

	"A social divide continues to grow between draconians who have wealth and those who don't. Many of those with wealth greedily cling to the shadows of their former tyrannical glory, but other draconians seek instead to bury the past and create their own destiny, on their own merits.": "拥有财富和没有财富的龙人之间的社会鸿沟不断扩大。许多拥有财富的人贪婪地留恋着昔日暴政荣耀的阴影，而其他龙人则试图埋葬过去，凭自己的本事创造属于自己的命运。",
	"Following the end of the Draconian order, the ravenites ventured into the world eager to make the most of their newfound freedom.

Soon after, the war climaxed in a wave of total destruction that left much of Exandria in ruins. Thousands of years of history were reduced to ash—and in that ash were buried many of these selfsame relics. Some of those not lost were passed down through bloodlines for generations, becoming potent symbols of authority and rulership. Others were sealed away by those who feared their power. These mighty echoes of the war that nearly shattered Exandria and the divine banishment that followed are known as the Vestiges of Divergence.": "这些（%0%）的遗物让凡人拥有了神一般的力量，也让（%1%）的战争升级到了白热化的程度。不久之后，战争在一场全面毁灭的浪潮中达到高潮，埃克桑德里亚大部分地区成为废墟。数千年的历史化为灰烬，灰烬中埋葬着许多同样的遗物。其中一些没有遗失的遗物通过血脉世代相传，成为权威和统治者的有力象征。另一些则被惧怕其力量的人封存起来。这些几乎摧毁埃克桑德里亚的战争以及随之而来的神圣放逐的强大回声被称为分歧遗迹。",
	"The Vestiges of Divergence are unique even among legendary magic items, for each one touches the defiant soul of its wielder and grows in power alongside them. The base state of a Vestige of Divergence is its dormant state, which the item returns to if sealed away or otherwise kept from being attuned by a worthy individual for a long period of time. A dormant state still imbues a modicum of power to an attuned wielder. But with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige of Divergence can regain access to some of its lost power in its awakened state. Eventually, if its bearer overcomes personal hardship and transforms their own soul, a Vestige of Divergence reaches its full potential in its exalted state. This shows the true power of the item, as it was when first utilized in the (%0%) against gods armed for war.": "即使在传奇魔法物品中，分歧的遗迹也是独一无二的，因为每件遗迹都能触动持有者不屈的灵魂，并与他们一起增强力量。分歧圣物的基本状态是休眠状态，如果被封印起来或长时间不被有价值的人调试，物品就会恢复休眠状态。休眠状态仍会给调谐后的持有者带来些许力量。但随着时间、毅力和个人成长，分歧圣物可以在唤醒状态下重新获得部分失去的力量。最终，如果佩戴者克服了个人的困难，并改变了自己的灵魂，分歧圣物就能在升华状态下发挥出全部潜能。这显示了该物品的真正威力，就像它首次用于（%0%）对抗武装到牙齿的诸神时一样。",
	"The point at which a character finds a Vestige of Divergence, as well as the point at which that item starts to unlock its full power, is entirely in the hands of the Game Master—though it is a topic that players and GMs can discuss and mutually scheme over between game sessions. The acquisition of such an item—or the discovery of its true identity—has the potential to be a scene of momentous narrative weight. Those who bear a Vestige of Divergence are respected and feared by those who understand these items' true power. But such an honor can also paint a target on the bearer's back, for many covet such power, and would do anything to obtain it.": "角色在什么时候发现 \"分歧之符\"，以及该物品在什么时候开始释放全部力量，完全掌握在游戏大师的手中--尽管这是一个玩家和游戏大师可以在游戏过程中讨论和共同谋划的话题。获得这样一件物品，或者发现它的真实身份，有可能成为一个具有重大叙事意义的场景。拥有 \"分歧徽章 \"的人，会受到那些了解这些物品真正力量的人的尊敬和畏惧。但这种荣誉也会让持有者成为众矢之的，因为许多人都觊觎这种力量，并不惜一切代价获取它。",
	"Many of the Vestiges of Divergence detailed in this section can currently be found in Tal'Dorei, while others are scattered elsewhere throughout Exandria. Some of these relics remain lost to time, waiting for someone to find them among the dust and rubble. Others might be in use by powerful heroes ready to pass the item's power onto a worthy successor who fights for the proper cause. Still others might be in the hands of twisted souls using them to terrorize the weak and defenseless. The Vestiges of Divergence are both magic items and narrative devices, and it's the GM's choice as to where any one of them might be found or earned.": "本节详述的许多分歧遗迹目前都可以在塔尔多雷找到，而其他遗迹则散落在埃克桑德里亚的其他地方。其中一些遗迹已经消失在时间的长河中，等待着有人在尘土和瓦砾中发现它们。还有一些可能正被强大的英雄们使用着，他们准备将物品的力量传给为正确事业而战的有价值的继承者。还有一些可能在扭曲的灵魂手中，用来恐吓弱者和手无寸铁的人。分歧的遗迹既是魔法物品，也是叙事工具，至于在哪里可以找到或获得它们，则由游戏管理者决定。",

	"A character discovers a facet of their destiny that calls their actions toward a dangerous cause—and against their own fear, they accept their fate and responsibility.": "一个角色发现了自己命运的一个侧面，这个侧面要求他们的行动朝着危险的方向前进--他们不顾自己的恐惧，接受了自己的命运和责任。",
	"A character claims vengeance against a rival who has tormented them for ages.": "一个角色要求向折磨了他很久的对手复仇。",
	"A character known for restraint gives in to the amoral violence that the relic they bear was dedicated to.": "一个以克制著称的角色屈服于无道德的暴力，而他们所携带的遗物正是为这种暴力而献身的。",
	"If you want to keep the Vestiges \"balanced,\" in addition to being narratively significant, then characters may find a dormant Vestige before 11th level—perhaps unaware that it's even a Vestige! That dormant Vestige is awakened somewhere between 11th and 17th level, and is exalted at any time after that. Even using these level ranges as a rule of thumb, you shouldn't rely too heavily on those mechanical benchmarks. A (%0%) advancement is triggered by character development, not simply by leveling up.": "如果你想保持 \"遗迹 \"的 \"平衡\"，并使其具有重要的叙事意义，那么角色可能会在 11 级之前发现一个休眠的 \"遗迹\"--或许还不知道它是一个 \"遗迹\"！休眠的遗迹会在 11 到 17 级之间被唤醒，并在之后的任何时间被升华。即使将这些等级范围作为经验法则，也不应过于依赖这些机械基准。提升（%0%）是由角色发展触发的，而不仅仅是等级提升。",

If (%3%) is used by a Huge giant, attacks made using the maul deal (%4%) bludgeoning damage.": "除非该物品是武器，否则 (%0%) 的游戏统计数据在调整大小时不会改变。当大型或更大型的生物使用这种武器进行攻击时，武器的持有者每大于中型，武器就会造成一个额外的伤害值。例如，如果 (%1%) 被大型侏儒使用，那么使用长弓进行攻击时会造成 (%2%) 的穿刺伤害。如果 (%3%) 由巨型巨人使用，则使用长弓攻击时会造成 (%4%) 暴击伤害。",
	"When the god-war spread across Exandria, no creature was safe, no matter how small and insignificant, no matter how mighty and powerful.

	"The answer—perhaps ironically, given how the arcane arts and a hunger for godhood brought about the Calamity—lay in magic of both arcane and divine provenance. Not paltry charms or trinkets, but the kind of magic that suffuses the ley lines of this world and plucks at the very fabric of reality. True, a mortal army may be naught but a cloud of gnats to the gods, but a singular hero—or villain—wielding an artifact imbued with magic beyond reckoning...such a champion could bring their strength and cunning to bear amidst the devastation of the god-war.": "答案或许很讽刺，因为奥术和对成神的渴求导致了灾变的发生，而答案就在于既神秘又神圣的魔法。这不是微不足道的符咒或饰品，而是弥漫在这个世界的雷系中、破坏现实结构的魔法。诚然，凡人的军队对诸神来说可能只是浮云，但如果有一位英雄或恶棍挥舞着一件蕴含着无穷魔力的神器......这样的勇士就能在神战的浩劫中发挥出他们的力量和智慧。",
