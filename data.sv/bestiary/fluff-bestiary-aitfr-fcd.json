De ville inte att Tyreus skulle bli indragen i ett liv med faror och skallefiering - vilket var vanligt i Ravnica. Men Tyreus kom att förstå att åtminstone en del av hans fars motiv för att förbjuda magi var Tyberios eget uppror mot sina äventyrliga föräldrar. När han fick veta att hans mormor en gång hade varit en mäktig magiker ville Tyreus följa i hennes fotspår.",

In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience."

Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility."
