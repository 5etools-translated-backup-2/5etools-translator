Det fungerar som en dyster påminnelse om hans förflutna.",

Han hyser agg mot Harpers och Ryllia för att de fängslade honom på en plats som påminner honom om de människor han förlorade i sin barndom, även om han också finner en viss tröst i att kunna leva det liv han kunde ha haft. Den tid han tillbringat ensam med sina tankar i Wisteria Vale har fått honom att misstänka att Harperna aldrig skulle hitta ett botemedel och att de helt enkelt väntade på sin tid tills han blev tillräckligt självgod för att de skulle kunna döda honom utan att han skulle utgöra ett hot. Quills korruption har övertygat honom om att Harperna har blivit en mäktig kraft som måste tas ner; han litar bara på sig själv när det gäller att identifiera och eliminera tyranniets agenter.",

Den lilla gruppen bosatte sig så småningom i skogen nära Baldurs Gate, där de rekryterar nya medlemmar.

If the crystal is destroyed, both Zikran's handheld device and the cannon become powerless. The crystal is a Large object with AC 13, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage."
